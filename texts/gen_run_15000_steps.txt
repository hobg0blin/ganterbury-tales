Balade that Chaucier made.
* A carte stood with endelong
In the road ther-as this sothe,
Stacked with hayes, and machines,
That Ware dwelte in wyn and in pisses,
And called was carte of reyn and shene.
The wordes of the Devel were in his wyse,
Whan he shit the wyn, as men teche a Iay.
Biforn him stood, it zoned,
The reule of ceint and of asshen colde;
And when he shit the asses cheek,
He made him white as malodow,
And eek the asses cheek.
And after that,
Out of the sunet came to him anon
With spewing of intermente,
And spray of gore, and blody knyf,
That nailed hir hoses eek in the spence.
And ever in oon he sang and he shriven,
And so biforn him feste and joyn,
That made alle men to mancioun and to solas.
Ever whan that he sang, men knewe his weye,
And caste awey the feteres that they mighte gon;
They wende he was semeresh for to singe.






But nathelees, upon heigh suggestion
Of his song, and al his ordinaunce,
The mairnes caste on his belles,
And blew the bukkes grete and smale,
The tankres on his heres, and al his heres,
That stank so, that wyn and ale was ther.
Of alle the wrecches that I have in my tretat,
This is to seyn, that ever, whyl that I live,
I am dyseyned for to here.
Thus can I now, sin I have my behame,
Sith I am noght dear to Crist,
And that the world is governed ther-by.
But ever I wasesar, sith that I teche,
Was wedded to hir housbonde, ben Rockingham,
That Maius highte Delphos,
That Nathaniah highte Karla,
And eek hir wyf Iohn was armede.
I loved hir housbond so, that I deyde,
Though my deyde made it som newe grave;
Al were it never so newe as my brother,
That many a sweet dove sholde peynte his shode.
But now is he gone, possibly never to dye;
I telle yow wel, for myn herte was wood!
But so bifel, I dyen wel and pleye,
I coude never eft comen in the snare.
I dye when I was in the snare,
For sikirly my deeth sclaundre myn offyce;
Thus can I gifte truely atte fulle.
But oh my chestre, how may it shame thee
To gifte me honestee,
And net-her-with nuditye and unluste,
And namely the love of Cristes love?
Allas! and also avoutrie of myn herte!
Why wolde I thanne, I kan nat sodeynly
What clothing that I mighte clothingly veil my herte
In? God help me so, it is so curbed!
Silence is no-thing, stuff that God and Crist
Hath wolde maked me to appear as I smalle.
And if I appear as I smale,
God help me so, as man that loveth me so,
That ech of us pair so sore shal dye,
And that no good be þe by-cause of my game,
That he ne shal helpe me-self in my tale;
For both of us art he desyren to be here;
And eek to ben yong and old, and builden is to-broke,
And Sathan (and that I water Kaye)
So wisly god, that sit in magestee,
And guide me in-to magestee, I wol redy here;






This king, this Aurelius,
His wyf eek so holy, and eek so heree,
And eek hir housbond so longe, and tendre
That loken in-to mariage;
Thus seyn men, as ever they wolde or seye.
But tendre youthe hath day andWol with her grace no wyse my sorowes sounde.

Greet was the feste in Athenes that day,
And eek the lusty seson of that May
Made every wight to enclyne and deckle,
And for to drinken strong is merier still,
Than hadde they dronken the sote in tweye.
The feend in Sweyn hadde a battle-hardhe rokke,
With camires and with knyves of backwoods;
Of kinges blode of Marrokke is heren on hir heed.
Ther-to he rokke was so clene stille,
That wolde han been stick, if that he walke or pleye.
Ful ofte tyme he was sore shy,
And conceyved to been a levisshee,
And to ben armed of whyte and rede.
But haunteth hir, it is no doute,
She sitteth to the reynes,
And peyneth hir to suit haukkes bone,
And seyde, 'allas! your craft is doon, your sleighte
Is em-deployed, it sal not be y-kned;
But for to stonde at this tyme, I wol say yow sooth,
My lady and my love, and siththen damnas!
Your wyf is to blame, for ay shame;
For what man that is he nedes calle
By presente signes, a goddes name!
Sir, save your grace, I wol nat Iape,
But Iapke votres, they to the peple leke.
Go now thy wey, I have no patience
To pleyen any more of this;
But to Shrede, do thy vengeance.'






This worthy knight answerde,
And seyde, 'allas! your knight is deed
On-foot, and that anon he comen was
To pleyen in-to our occean,
And in your court he loketh to and fro.
And whan that he us bigan, he gan to crye
'Wher is my lordes swete lechour,
Doonye his blody knyf, what do ye heer?'






'What, who artow?' 'It am I,' quod he,
'Who is your lord? good sir, and who is your brother?'






'Iesu Crist,' quod he, 'and seynt Benedight,
And seynt Thomas, and seynt Ronye also,
Preyre hir hondes in armes, so that they wene
To drinke ferme draughtes in the sithen bath;
Seynt Eugène, and seynt Valerian also,
That of hir swerdings loked wonder faste.
One of hem, that was in regnes sheeld him so hy in pence,
For that he wolde bireve the table that he prively
Out of the chambre, and remoeve the rest;
Seynt Piers Alfonce, seynt Valente also,
Ne making of this day the avente fishery,
With twenty-first Breed and thirteen oon,
Shal be sopyt, the king of Egypt;
Of your romances, good sir, certeyn,
We knowen alle the harneys in the toun.
And after that, thanne shul we see
The soper wel, what that it shal coste,
And eek the spoil y-cleped in the toute.
And after that, thanne shul we see
The dive tsariously, and the lay
Wher-as that he dide hir lecherye.






And after that, I rede, with great sheelding,
That we putte hem fro the bottleiddes herte,
And posthalle hem in the ponthe of Rome.
And who-so wol exercyse the citee,
Or telle hir constance, I holde him shene.
For who-so womman can exercyse
The peple, we knowe wel that it is wrong.
And Selmoeym, whan he exercyse
The peple of Rome, seith: 'in helle is noon harm.'
And of Aphithaxius comth Roce of TOf sondry folk, by aventure y-falle
In felawshipe, and pilgrims were they alle,
That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde;
The chambres and the stables weren wyde,
And wel we weren esed atte beste.
And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,
Thus ended the faire Caunterbury,
And eek the goode sonne goode and service,
And lyk a hostiler here;
Now wol I torne to my tale agayn:—






This sely carpenter, that was ful wys,
Tolde alle his serwes how he could
Free, y-wis, and eek in what wyse
He wolde suffre, whyl that he was on lyve,
And so bifel, that he, Joseph,
Hath riden in-to the toun,
And gonee his wey; and Prothetheres wyf,
That wolde han kept hem fro the quarve,
Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste
Y-passed been; than lat hir go to feste.
And so bifel, that in the parky
Sid helmes they caste their eye,
For fere of which tirauntialitee
Ther shewed he that they were in penaunce;
And whan they were grete, they moste ear,
And seyde, 'allas! sire, the day is come,
That I ne shal be lost, my lyf is in helle!
I am so confus, that I can noght seye
His saylech, so bole I myd eres now!
For blame, I knowe wel, that they ben treacherouse;
My wit is short, thou mayst nat pleyne hem to helle.
But this,' quod he, 'is yet the beste reed,
That yet I see a Slavon, a Croat,
Or an Arrok, or a Balik,
That hath y-wonne a ceptre here.
For in swich regnes been alle gode,
That fro the hyeste rokkes blake
Were it by aventure or by nature
Hadde I nat a capul virginius,
To sitten in a yeldhalle of erthe,
And make preestes ayeles for to serve,
And goon to offring biforn his meynee;
And eek he hath a book that honoureth hir honour,
Which that he seith, seint Iulian,
Of whom that she was lyk the mode,
As seith the book, soothly to teche.
Biforn him is a tree, as wel y-wet
As any sautrye, and for as muche
Of any thing that bireveth him his heed,
He gat na-more of it by owene së.






'Honour,' seith he, 'is wonne by dissipacioun;
Ful ofte tyme, the minstralcye,
And eek the bauderye of longe estat;
For wel ye woot that, duringe promiscence,
Sinantion, and even stealinge hir herte proudly,
This is a game of increasing the wratthe of the pie.
They goten ther by sleighte, by force,
This mote, which that was maked of a cake,
Ful wel y-shaped, and feryed on the pg.
And therfore, sire, so wel ye woot,
It is an impossible disport
For to walke by the weye alone.
Ther is no bote, SRight, ne no covenable,
To seke a fer, so farwel, allas!
Think wel, how that the feend seith,
"A bettre worshipe oon,
If he be hende, of him it is a game."
Doon thenne thy devoir at once
Of ech of hem, so that ye may nat seye
But that they been mirthe and no gladnesse;
And thenketh, lordes, upon the galwes blinde;
"A wyf may nat been hid of hir peple,
She woot as sheweth," quod he,
"Sheweth," quod she, "how that the bread is y-So hote he lovede, that by nightertale
He sleep namore than dooth a nightingale.






For whan he had herd what was comaunded him,
He weep, and him excuseth pity;
And biknoweth pitee, good Beautee,
Hir bringe hir to swich pitous lyf?
Allas! she nadde holde him by his limes!
Wherfore his herte she preyde hir honour,
And eek hir hesteppe, the more for to telle,
And thanne hir herte sadeth for to doon him wrong.
Strong is this proverbe, and wel antivyse,
And recomende to the office of man.







A good Advocke (telleth us this tale),
By-cause that he was a man of lawe,
And sicer asoune, he hadde a wyf;
And she was of askek, wel informed,
Of every thing that mighte han witnesse,
And more of a command than hir heed.
Thus taughte me my dame, I sey na-more.






This sotted preest, that of his purveyance
Drinketh more than water in a single toute,
'Curteys,' quod he, 'and nat for alle purveyaunce;
For thank of god, that is for evergreene,
sith that it is suffisaunt to us
To doon al our entente, wel advised we.'






'Ful many a man,' quod she, 'and many a womman
Wol han child, so let me this fraudulent tale
Som-tyme, as for tespye and elde,
And for our hedes, which that we tere
Of al the remenant of our tale.
But so bifel, so god me save,
As keep me fro thy vengeaunce and thyn ire,
And namely fro that tree that stouneth here,
Iesu Crist, to knitte up the hertes of us tweye,
And make us live in vertu and in grace.'






'Elles,' quod he, 'laaste my dede,
And lat me slepe under the woode,
That brennen of the tree ther-as Iesu Crist
Hath shapen, his moder slow, to be our wyf;
And if so be the game wente aright,
She shal make a chevisaunce for me and for myn interest,
And eek I make a grete feste of chevisaunce
For touching of the nonneroute,
That is to seyn, what shal I reneye here?
For who-so loked to god, he sholde seye
Of alle the harmes that he hath in his body.
So ferde another clerk with astromye;
He made a chartre of the place,
And seyde, 'allas! oasis, how I go
In-to this chirche for to poure,
And in the chirche he it afered.
Unthank come on his hand that ne may;
And he that me broghte first, to-morwe I wol holde him wyse.'






'Now maister,' quod this preest, 'I yow biseke.'


'No maister, sire,' quod he, 'but servitour,
Thogh I have had in scole-matere greet perfeccioun,
And that Iorwer hadde the sighte as he fledde,
And many a thank that I have to him amonge,
And eek another, ministre, and convict,
And somtyme war, and somtyme pees,
And eek the good that we can together kepe;
And so bifel that, er that we departen heer,
We compaignen to his deeth, his fader dere.






And by the thridde cause, as seith Machabee,
That 'in wikked conseil wommen venquisshed been,
That for pulpithes been lesinges and deceyved,
And for we han mirthe and in justice
Y-don the world, ther it is enshrined.'
Thus seden the noble whippoor of Australia;
Ther-as ther nis namore to seye,
WherGinglen in a whistling wind as clere,
And eek as loude as dooth the chapel-belle,
Ther as this lord was keper of the celle.
The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit,
By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,
This ilke monk leyde the keye of his celle,
And wente his wey, no lenger wolde he lette,
Til he cam to his abbot, and bad hir strete.






'In name of Crist,' cryde this preest, 'dere brother,
Thou art a bailly, and I am another.
I am unknowen as in this contree;
Of thyn aqueyntance I wolde praye thee,
And eek of brotherhede, if that yow leste.
I have gold and silver in my cheste;
If that thee happe to comen in our shyre,
Al shal be thyn, right as thou wolt desyre.'






'Grantmercy,' quod this Somnour, 'by my feith!'
Everich in otheres hand his trouthe leith,
For to be sworne bretheren til they deye.
In daliance they ryden forth hir weye.






This frere in-to the toun his leges stronde,
And by the leges he al masse him spedde,
And eek his wyf, un-to the place y-set,
And loking in at the windowes angle.


The declarant, which that it sholde nat endyte,
With his false nose, the furot of hise eres,
His lippes rede, and his shone eyen two,
His loked windows broken ful faste,
And cast a hole in heuste length,
And ther he cam, to gravelly ssoughre hem alle.






'Rys up,' quod he, 'sir preest, and sey me thus;
My soule bitake I byemetree,
And god help me to-ward for to stele;
And eek my clothes ryde as whyt as is a rose;
And my man ryde is blue as the gleeman.
Therefore, for my wil I have my lyf in cure;
By goddes bones! who wende me if
To tellen ech of my wo that I have?
Oon of the gretteste auctours that men rede
Seith, that whyt was a book bisyde;
He wende ye were a yeman, I shal seye.
But for I wol not han to displese
Of recordinge, so herkneth how I sayde.
It lyth nat in my tonge, nin my conning;
I mean to SXene it, as much as me thinketh,
And wel SXene it is, and nethe some pye.
But so bifel, my lord so dere,
Avyseth it yow, and holdeth it noght.
He seith, it is a gentil tale,
And garnisshed is, as man that it lere.
And wel I woot, it nere baptesme
To place a man in heigh degree,
As wel to shewen his rite as to lye.
Accordereth he cam, and ledeth him to the stake.
And certes, lord, that is testamentsse,
With-outen witing of any other wight,
He holdeth the soper agayn the testamentsse.
And ther-up-on the wyn was fet anon;
Ful ofte tyme it was cheyned biforn.
And on the testament so feste was it,
That round was the face, and grete as any sparre,
In which, for to representen his degree,
He hadde a touching merveyle of golden yere.
Freres and slavees maken vertu of servage,
And noon other worldly thing they doon live,
But ech of hem maketh it for his profit;
And he was lyk a day or two ago,
That thogh the feend to loke on him every-deel,
In al his harneys and in his knightes heste,
He was wonder sory, as was the day.
And eek it was he slow of al his care;
He wypBet than a lazar or a beggestere;
For un-to swich a worthy man as he
Acorded nat, as by his facultee,
To have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.
It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce
For to delen with no swich poraille,
But al with riche and sellers of vitaille.
And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse,
Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.
Ther nas no man no-wher so vertuous.
He was the beste beggere in his hous;

252 c
Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;]
For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,
So plesaunt was his "In principio,"
yet wolde he have a ferthing.
His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.
And rage he coude, as it were right at his owene.
In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe.
For there he was nat lyk a cloisterer;
He was lyk a kingcinistre.
He hadde maad come down-on a day
With his thralles to Theseus paleys,
And hadde y-voyache y-nough suffysed.
And so bifel, on a day,
That day that mot he with his thralles stride
Hoom to his hous, he peyneth hem to wende.






To Rome is come this noble Theseus,
And fyndeth hem the righte way.
And hoom they goon, and hitte him by the quene,
And seyde, 'Man, if that it be your wille,
As thus, my lord, loke that it be good;
For wel I woot, it is no fruit but los of tyme;
Than have I nat thanne an hundred frankes.'






His lord answerde, 'thanne have I good mannes seel;
For wel I woot, it is a torment and a wo
To been under this hemispe and this fame.
For what man that is debonaire and meke,
Myn aventure is overwhelming.'






Wel coude he thanne, with this conseil,
Go and olde Romayn, and make him to dye.
Than sholde men seyn, it is a woodnesse a-rewe
To gender folk in engendrure;
Than wolde he thanne his tydinges singe,
And cryen, "how! how! how! how! lordinges! how! alle!
How may this blisful ladyrie
Himmered ever in Ire, and ther-inne shal be noon innocent."
Ah! why nadstow thanne be malevolente
To seye that zealous was Ire? certes, it may nat be so.
The blisful ladyrie, as in gifte,
Coveiteth people that it wol torne un-to chastitee,
And wel dwelleth in helle withinne;
It dooth no inniccioun to speak ne dede
Of love, that so litel shal be her bileve.
Lo, what seith god of his soule? it is a game
To heren of alle passion and of alle lust.






Passe over, and yet ich angre may bityde;
Men sette nat your love in greet adversitee,
Ne make man out of his angre ageyn.
For if he be oak, well shal he brenne;
Men sette it so, so standeth it so,
That neare tyme (as ye biforn-hir sayeth alle)
Men shul thinken it is fair to be bareyne,
And for it wol torne un-to chastitee;
And eek it is nat lyk a thing to be wood,
That hath but oon hole for to sterte to,
And if ther be som-tyme bitternesse in it,
That causeeth discord amonges folk, or love,
Or elles it is the beste archer,
That steleth honeys, as dooth the leoun,
Out of the eyre, til Cornelius comes;
He kepeth hir ay torch, and she hath it light;
It shal ben armes, she woot itIustyce he was ful often in assyse,
By patente, and by pleyn commissioun;
For his science, and for his heigh renoun
Of fees and robes hadde he many oon.
So greet a purchasour was no-wher noon.
Al was fee simple to him in effect,
His purchasing mighte nat been infect.
No-wher so bisy a man as he ther nas,
And yet he semed bisier than he was.
In termes hadde he caas and domes alle,
That from the tyme of king William were falle.
Therto he coude endyte, and make a thing,
Ther coude no wight pinche at his wryting;
And every statut coude he pleyn by rote.
He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote
Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale;
Of his array telle I no lenger tale.






A Frankeleyn was in his companye;
Whyt was hir beautee furie, and set ful hye;
Of herte shewe I no vitaille in this place;
But a clene linage hir of was,
A bittre doghter, that wolde hir suffisant.
The sones of the devel she sharede,
And eek the runcsoun of hir fader wood.
Thus can a king defende his emperour,
And make a lusty barge for hir hye,
And for hir love erect he was.

This yonge prince was thennes idolatrous,
And in his hand he bar
An holy croys, that esily
Invocailled was in martirdom.
Jesse he, that seith ful Almighty motthes,
'Lo, heer myn herte sticking.'






'O Chauntecleer, what seystow?
What ministre has ther noon?
What estat am I, that reverence?
I wol bireve holy chirche here,
If that I may, my brother dere.'






'Now, by my fader soule, brother dere,' seyde Gamelyn,
'Thou shalt nat so inch heavenward,
That thou into the herte of man rede,
That thou into the herte of myn ere brest eke.
For brother, thou shalt poure by a reed;
With thee lie the billon, by my fader kin!
For by my thrift, thou shalt nat the cesse
Of it my body, but a mighte be;
For it is a game to ieve it me time and lyte.'






'Thou shalt,' quod the maunciple, 'ful wel avyse,
Die 'ther you wolt, brother Gamelyn,
Than wol I erly putte, and turne coppes,
And have my body faire ladde.'






'I chaunge,' quod Gamelyn, 'by my fader soule,
But Ialous I wol refusee, brother,
To be bounden under this trop,
That never, whyl thee lasteth lyf ne breeth,
To goon to helle or goon to pare,
Neither by oon assent, ne by som manere accidn,
But-if it were, or elles were it by mescheef.'






'If it were,' quod he, 'lorigen it is,
And manhapen it were a game to him,
And thanne that he wol renne to the two
That were y-set, and comen hem in despyt.'






'I chaunge,' quod he, 'and make me gay,
And turne coppes, and I wol borwe
The coles, and make hem brawe;
I love love hir, Iate hir flesh,
And water, and fire, and VG Thetaq,
That shal fallen on my ground, if I may.'






'Twelf peny they of maistrie,' quod she,
'And to the chirche seyde, 'if it be
Sin that thou hast maistrie, and no-thing amis
Other, brother myn, but sin that thou art
Burstynly caught ofte sinne, apertenaunt,
ThatFor blankmanger, that made he with the beste.






Anon to drawen every lenger the street,
And thanne, er that it were eve,
He peyde the piè for to make,
And somme han drive in hir yën
Un-to the toun, and to the point right of Holt.
And, with a face deed as asshen colde,
He seyde, 'allas! this is a wikked Iape;
Now sir, lat me see, what nedeth wordes mo?
A! allas! this false knight myn Alisoun!
And now sir, lat me slepe, what wol ye seyn?
A! wher! wher! I smokste allas! almighty god,
That I so longe can slepen al your sheets!
A! wher! I smokste eek allas!'






Findinge in this mervaille,
The markis preesseth hir for to ryse,
And right anon she gan wepe,
And seyde, 'lord, dere nefthor,
As help me god, I may no lenger slake;
For sodeynly, I wol be at your halle,
And by the croys, al-so-muche as I have a name,
Doth al myn service, you for the nones!
But, lord, wiltow that I bringe anon
Yow in swich a rym, that I shal surprise you.'






This answerde, 'o! wel-nah, I wol nat lye;
I have y-founde in myn astrologye,
As I have thilke lym, this is my combat;
Beth war, I wol nat lye agayn.'






'Thilke ensample,' quod he, 'of a clerk,
That in his clerks lyf he lived,
And had a wyf that eek was his life.
What sholde I lye in scole of this?
She was so clear and so yong of age,
And so yong, that I dar wel sayn,
She was the verray devel of helle.
For sikerly, I dar right wel seyn,
Thogh she were of any maner age,
She sholde be deed, ther was noon so old and gon
That he ne livede in reste alone;
He brighte if she were a mousier or a povre pye.
But she was so gentil and so kinde,
For housbondrye, she wolde seye right no weel,
And so kinde, and so pecche eek so weel
As any moder mighte hir oblige.
Wel coude she carie a day or two
Memory of hir doctrina, and how she
And Cristes moder loved hir right as hir hertes bone.
Thus can we see, for verray purpose,
The heighe god of hevene loveth hir as he,
And eek can we see, for verray penitence,
The sely tonge weping Julia;
Beth al hir might, hir armes ladde and holde.






The norice of McKinley cam, and Shinien also,
With hood of greyn of Malenco;
They leden with hem ros and eek with bulles
The chirche, to seken up and doun.
Doun ther they sette Anelrede,
That sote in a cart, that standeth in the way
Of a freight werk; and hors anoon
He took, and eek hir camusee;
And thus, by oon assent,
They gon take hir leve, and wenten herte.
But noon of hem, certeyn, he made hir rage;
For she was irous and no-thing dreryveable.
Hir liste nat to knew his wil in al
Its ful avys, whan it was doon in herte.
I power tolde hir it was noght doon intentionally;
For conseil was hir counseil, it was no-thing so.
'Fader,' quod she, 'your child is now doon in pees;
I may not pleyne for to be your love,
But I wol love hir,Bold was hir face, and fair, and reed of hewe.






'Pandora,' quod she, 'by god that for us ne knowe,
Thou art a creature, and mayst nat pleyne
As fer as nature hath woman.
I am a king animal, and aske I

To maken swiche monkes asen and sore,
To telle swiche regnes as they were,
And for to tellen hem vertu, and alle

Our king, which that highte Salomon,
Hath of his sone y-born, as he goth by the weye.
And whan he wered of deeth his lettre a day,
And eek his lettre, sworn was he,
He lulleth in his regne and plyt
The same day that he sholde er this calf,
And immediately heeld it, and eek it his wyf,
And swoor hir name was Angelus.
With this queynte day he camera,
And eek many another day he spedde,
To starke hem in the shode and the place,
And swoor he wolde han hir for to mete
For al the necessitee that it han.
'Doghter,' quod he, 'hir name is magnificence,
And ther-to god hath dede hir hye.'






'Ye, true Angelus,' quod she,
'Thou art my spiritos so dere;
My purpose was reys, and that she
Wol have my body in dissever;
But she, lord, so rede me angelus,
Iose the lettre, to thy worship and my plyt,
That I may wel been out of this care;
For love of god, that for us alle deyde,
And interest of thy regne and myn excercyse.'






'Gladly,' quod he, 'and elles axeth echon,
Me fro the false knight, Mistral,
That charged me with monkes evermo;
He served his lord, and lay ful stille,
As clerkes, for al that ever they have in thee;
And hence adameth me to swich entente,
That I tooke for love, and no-thing for vyce.'






'I very much prefer,' quod she,
'That ye goon than peynen hem vitaille;
Elkken aright, somone hath ben proude plight.
For wel thou woost thy-self, lady, looth to be proude,
That thou sworest for my Ipocrisye,
And Palamon, that hath thy lyf in plisoun;
And eek Arcite, that galst for love of me,
And eek yet other knightes myn,
That causen yow to resten hastily?'






'Yis,' quod he, 'ful yore ago.'


'Hastow nat herd,' quod she, 'also the cas,
In which ther dwelleth Micolabe,
And eek the dedes, of whiche that I neede?'






'Yis,' quod he, 'ful yore ago.'


'And of whiche ther dwelleth Palamon,
That hath swich power of his wit,
That no wight can out of his sleighte;
And eek ther ben two, sone by senatour,
That walken in the gardin, and no-thing he ne wroght;
And speke of lechours, and clerkes, and bokes;
They been as means to telle a man the effect.
For al-be-it so that he may nat seen hem cominge,
For yet to-night til Athenes to-morphike,
Yet space he explore the gardin, and made him bare.
And som-tyme, trowinge, and simphonye
He coppeth of the sondry melodies,
That al the grove, that aske I now here;
The brydel, that wryteth up and doun;
The lutes, that sinken in-to the,
That wenden som draughtegs that they wroghte;
And the swerdes, that goon to the moonlight-way;
ThePlowman, was his brother,
That hadde y-lad of dong ful many a fother,
A trewe swinker and a good was he,
Livinge in pees and parfit charitee.
God loved he best with al his hole herte
At alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte,
And thanne his neighebour right as him-selve.
He wolde thresshe, and ther-to dyke and delve,
For Cristes sake, for every povre wight,
Withouten hyre, if it lay in his might.
His tythes payed he ful faire and wel,
Bothe of his propre swink and his catel.
In a tabard he rood upon a CRT,
In holpeak and in rightwerk,
That to the harneys of Jerusalem he preyde;
To the harneys of Itaille welkin he cryde,
To the harneys of Iulius he preyde;
To the hostelrye also he preyde,
To the freres that saten there,
His hye peple to preye for him of his favre,
And seyde, 'lord, the lord have on me!
I have to yow,' quod he, 'y-dore agilt,
This whyte lamb, that is myiour,
Which that I took for my flesh in veyn,
And in chirche ground up-on my mudewyn,
For sikernesse of my body, and also for veyn
Of my soule, of which I youve my body,
To yow, my body, and my soule reste;
Noght helpeth it to-morwe by day,
But seyde animally, with-outen doute,
"Aboel alle thy freendes, and thou his axento,
And think on eche, who-so yeveth hem semblable.
Sire, I wol pose for my manshipe,
That in this tion whylom I have slayn.'






That other answerde, 'fo, heer our lord,
His mooder is needful, for we shal him avyse
We see of love, that so we doon in our bole;
For trewely, gold is well spent, as I gesse'—
And for that no-thing of that text,
Not only the dede of it,
But eek the desyr to doon that we wole.
And therefore positif lawe and swich decree
Is broke al-day for love, in ech degree.






Auctour of this bille, is ful royally
Of coursers, that ther-as the bille sit,
And ther-as ther is swich prepossession
Of ech degree, as I seyde erst,
That wyf is mannes fader, and hir aspys.
This world is nat so strong, it is no nay,
That wommen can nat creacioun
Of attemperaunce and of pryde;
Systematice and itys, they been al taxes,
And hir houses darken hem in Iape.
And so bifel, that in al this route
Logik, that was this bille gent,
Billed was a goddes halfe coursers,
And eek a halfe piler,
And on the floor ther stant a frere;
So hote he was, and wood, and bone, and jointe;
Tho semed ech of hem both to been.
Tho, for verray beste he wente,
And coude so wel thanne, for it was payed,
That to the payemente bothe he and she
Hir dresses, clothe, and array, and greet multplesse.
But al for noght, he was short-shaven, brood,
And cariede in-to the toun, no lenger wolde he slowe,
And coude thanken hem in swich wyse,
That whylom weren of so greet estat.
And so bifel, that to the parish-chirche,
That was the meeting place,
He thikke, and sitthe al the werk, and ther-to he lay,
And vouchsafaunt was his actes and his werkes,
That for the moste sake, and for his peple preye,
HeAnd by his covenaunt yaf the rekening,
Sin that his lord was twenty yeer of age;
Ther coude no man bringe him in arrerage.
Ther nas baillif, ne herde, ne other freend,
That he ne knew ther-of, and knewe it bet.
They weren of eloquence the benisouns,
That wonen, whyl that the world wolde him wirche.
They weren the preestes, and Winne hem by right,
That made hir housbondes for to dye;
They weren eek swich asen Wynandoes,
That romanceres, that been of the servaunts
Til Iesu Crist; and swich asen his wyf.
Now ryde they unto the toun,
And caste hir haters stump, and cfilk hem nat rekene.






The Reve was a sclendre colerik man,
His berd was shave as ny as ever he can.
His heer was by his eres round y-shave.
His top was dokked lyk a preest biforn.
Ful longe were his legges, and ful lene,
Y-lyk a staf, ther was no calf y-sene.
Wel coude he kepe a gerner and a binne;
Ther was noon auditour coude on him winne.
Wel wiste he, by the droghte, and by the reyn,
The yelding of his seed, and of his greyn.
His lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye,
His swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultrye,
Was hoolly in this reves governing,
And by his covenaunt yaf the rekening,
Sin that his lord was twenty yeer of age;
Ther coude no man bringe him in arrerage.
Ther nas baillif, ne dayerye, ne groomerye;
And for it was for al he thider loked,
That he was out of his plantation
To doon a correccioun on his glade.
His brother was a sclendre colerik man,
And by the beddes he was Gretel of Snaille.
Ful smale y-VEyned he and eek a smale lamb,
That was Bettelblak of Snaille, and Custelayne.
Ful fresh and bloody was the reioysaunce,
That upon the auter spak this mot cannot-was,
That he that gnatured was al that he knewe,
And many a yeer his service;
Wel was the werre of his wit.
This holy monk, ryotour de Anselm,
Hath emptied the semes of al the world,
And right thus ful longe purpos seyn he;
'By god, I am lief than lal myn herte breke.
Yet has my felawe som-what for his harm;
He has the milleris doghter in his arm.
He auntred him, and has his nedes sped,
And I loketh up-on him at un-to wedde.
But who-so coude in al myn herte see,
Ther-as he sholde auntred him, I dar wel sayn;
He may seen of his peynes sote,
And alle his subtiltee and his ordinaunce,
By oon that hath a touching in myn hond.
For stricken is myn herte on him so dere;
I telle noght as touching of his degree,
But for his offyce Iotening of myn humylitee;
And so bifel that, one day, this clerk,
That was so plesant un-to myn offyce,
Which that I to him had longe avysed me,
Considereth my misdoinge, and referth me
To tortuous, degrading, and servauntouryce;
And eek I rekke of his order of matrimoine,
As wel of hise eres of liege,
As of his moderres accorde with heres hote;
This is to seyn, that if a clerk wit,
Thou may see right thus, or elles truthfully,
That alle the rightes of popesre heste,
And eek the heste of philosophes,
Rome.
And Homer, which that me reneye,
Seith, as men may with wrything of a pin,
'Werk my soule with-outen wo and stryf.'
And Percy, which that knew al hir science,
And who sat in the court at that tyme,
Heed of this knight, 'he was a good equinut,
And reuled was life, and reuled was his wyf.
She was a joy to man, and eek a sorwe;
Hir name was alwey 'prudence.'
And eek therto he was y-cleped a 'dar.
He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre,
Ther nas no tonge, but bekke a gerland of the verray lengthe
Of any breed, or any pride of any lord;
And named was this 'Emelye,' that was his maister.
And over al this, to tellen as it was,
He dressd up his nekke, so as ye shal here.






This 'Emelye,' that ladies wroghte of his proceding,
With herte debonaire, and greet corage,
And swoor, whan he wolde goon, men wolde him haule
To wrecched hem, for oyen relikes that he hadde.
And forth he gooth, no lenger wolde he tarie,
Into the toun, un-to a pothecarie,
And preyed hem to helpe him cristendomaily.
His felaw taughte him homward prively;
And thus, with delyt, the world was his plogh.
For wel he wolde have werre the world,
And with his freendes hadde a cherche of spinnete,
That whan he bar up-on a tree he reason
Why he wolde cherche off a fruyt;
For whyl that he was yet in love-longinge,
He wolde han riden more than verray prisoun
Out of that world, if that he mighte han.
For who-so wolde him avyse,
Seyde, "how! Wilow! how! Darcy! how! Atlas!
Wilow! CounSEil, how! Lys, Atlas!
How! Regnes, Regnes! how! Brakke, Clekke,
How! Dobie, be ye nat syk?
Is this the moste reys of prys?
Or is it because I have a ferthing?
Regnes, it is a greet disese,
And mostly it restsen by day.
But at night, som tyme avysement
IS of olde Robin, that hath birked us;
And in our cave, far-wel, er we departe,
IT ARWES MESSENGERS.







THE THREE WOODSES.



The trilogy apples, whiche that were maked of Caes,
Were carryen in good wil by Lucan,
And ifrit by Attheon,
Hadde al hir lyf and al hir body,
Ther nis y-fostred man, al-though that he
Hath mordred bothe his yonge men.
The trilogy is so long, I may nat tellen
Whether it be night, or day, or night-shift,
Or what-so that it containeth in paperback,
And whete it hem alphabetically.
And er that he had broght hem alphabetically,
He wolde it hoppen by the leeste weye,
And topte hir with-inne a litel whyle.
And whan that he had broght hem alphabetically,
He wolde it alle robeccioun,
And give it to the proude charity
Which that men han thilke day that they boghte
To No-thing for renging of clothing,
But eek for uplift of spirit, and for to doon
Hem to kepe, and for to recollecte
The passeth ful successfully, so wisly be,
That bet than never, two yeer atte leste,
Sin that ther is no tonge shal falle.
For thogh the feend winnen in no manere,
It lyen so, na-more than for a day,
That in a day or two shal hem mixe.
AndThe wordes mote be cosin to the dede.
And thus, lorel, we alle rendezen here.






He that me remembreth of my yow humilitee,
And eek my brotheres degree,
In werk, thogh I sholde han writen a tale,
So wel ye wolde been his wyf, trowinge,
And turning him on his bare knees agayn.
She feleth him on hir knees with humble herte,
And him saleweth, by right,
Fro day to day, as him liste on his calendar.
For though he kepe him fro the sinnes sevene,
And eek from every branche of every tree,
Yet is ther so parfit felicitee,
And so greet ese, that he wol natesse
But swoor, 'allas! o myn hors, deffye!'
And thanne at erst he loked as a tare,
And priked as he were wood:






'So theek,' quod he, 'ful wel coude I yow plese,
What nedeth yow my wyf to engendren me,
So that I mighte han growen evene elmes,
And thanne so wolde I plye
The prisoun of my tale for to make.
But nathelees, I dar seye the same,
That right as my wyf is grene un-to hir lyf,
So stant this monteyn in myn herte.
Sin that I see of hir heighe paleys,
I yow forbede, out of doute,
That whyl I moorne hir in the lunnesse.






The day is comen of hir departinge,
I sey, her names been som-tyme castenes,
That ech of hem hadde other tale.
But nathelees, I dar wel seyn that thilke day
The markis liveth in greet honour,
And of his servyse he is still extant.
Who coude telle, but he had wedded be,
In what degree, and under what name;
And eek in what language;
But shortly for to telle is myn assent.
This occasion may nat faille,
Of which I inform yow wel, my wil is this.
I wol bistowe the minister of mariage
This same night hir service extorcions,
And al the ground of hir judgements.






This newlyweddinge, which that portion
Y-comen is, I holde it for the beste.
For though that he ne publicly it declared,
He tacitly took hir to his warde-chamber,
And of hir privately he seyde heste.
Thus in dede Iustene he holde it for the beste.






Greet chere made our day, par ma fay,
That to the soper sette I;
Thus in al my lyf I wol be.
Of al the healing of this soper,
Sin that it was newe aventure,
I holde it for the beste.
For though that he seyde he fond no good womman,
Yet hir posession made him daunce
To doon that same hote hogges two,
Of which the name of seint Edward.
Therto he leyde a morning apparence,
Air going was, and Jennur al coude;
But magik power mot he have?
For who can teche and werchen as we conne?
And for whom we bileve in drinkes
BBCore, bothe morning and afternoon,
And hostes coude and halles made we;
And maistres of cathe, and gold-thred was our strete,
And othere fote of adamant eterne,
And helmes bokeler, and helmes gretter,
And helmes relikes, day and night, by oon assent,
To eten with our plesaunce in reste.
And so bifel, that in the same wyse
The thridde night, falling in our passioun,
If that we come to Rome, i quitte.
For in swich place ryde we;
And in her noble roysed is the hevene,
And in the mede of pryde al the IAnd sette a soper at a certeyn prys;
And we wold reuled been at his devys,
In heigh and lowe; and thus, by oon assent,
We been acorded to his Iugement.
And ther-up-on the wyn was fet anon;
We dronken, and to reste wente echon,
With-outen any lenger taryinge.






A-morwe, whan that day bigan to springe,
Up roos our host, and was our aller cok,
And gadrede us togidre, alle in a flok,
And forth we riden, a litel more than pas,
Un-to the watering of seint Thomas.
And there our host bigan his hors areste,
And seyde; 'Lordinges, herkneth, if yow leste;
Ye woot your forward, and I it yow recorde.
If even-song and morwe-song acorde,
Lat se now who shal telle the firste tale.
As ever mote I drinke wyn or ale,
Who-so be rebel to my Iugement
Shal paye for al that by the weye is spent.
Now draweth cut, er that we ferrer twinne;
He which that hath the shortest shal biginne.
Sire knight,' quod he, 'my maister and my lord,
Now draweth cut, for that is myn acord.
Cometh neer,' quod he, 'my lady prioresse;
And ye, sir clerk, lat be your shamfastnesse,
Ne studieth noght; ley hond to, every man.'








The Canterbury Tales.











Anon to drawen every wight bigan,
And shortly for to tellen, as it was,
A tale, the closing of my tale;
The courtneek, as of the nones,
Seith that the beste reed I can,
And al is y-told, for rote of tale,
In manere of a cok, if that I shal seye sooth.
The Merry Wursofte, whan he sholde outlawe
His doghter for al his regne,
And make a general congregacion,
For which he was greeting, wel to seye;
And by the same suyte he taughte echoon
This false king, that Iustinesse,
And eek another, that ruled with hir honde
In exces, as men may se;
And thus, my lord, I seye this tale for to touche;
Not that I sholde the cas requyrien
The regnes that been ordeyned and announced
In every cas, but that he wolde reneye hem alle
Out of the regne of regne hem to bringe.






Lo, heer the lettres seled of this thing,
That my lord and spere, god and seint Paul,
Seyn that Iankin clerk, to longe er his lyf
He wolde thider bringe United.
So sholde I thider bringe Americore,
And bringe him ful wel, if I smoot it shal.
This messager, this Iankin, the vertuous esoter,
That first of al this cas and that other,
That continueth to her lust and to his owene esoter,
Shal have right for profit, and that men liste here.
For just as men mighte axe daungerously
The heighe god that is in heaven,
And wiste it mighte lightly ryde
Over the our streets, right so right thus mighte he tilte
The egle, which that men clepeth in they ryse,
And by that same dede, lyen in his sheeld,
That Clintone hadde him yeven lond,
Inductinge the deeds that he leyde
To this tune, and eek the executaunce,
And eek the humilitee in divers art
Of engendrure, and pelisshinge of soules,
And affecture, and gerlandes, and ashre,
Of leyntees, and of wrastlinge;
And for to doon him al the confort
That wommen can not on hir savacioun;
So worth is to hem how that it is pAnd of the tempest at hir hoom-cominge;
But al that thing I moot as now forbere.
I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,
And wayke been the oxen in my plough.
The remenant of the tale is long y-nough.
I wol nat letten eek noon of this route;
Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute,
And lat see now who shal the soper winne;
And ther I lefte, I wol ageyn biginne.






This duk, of whom I make mencioun,
When he was come almost unto the toun,
In al his wele and in his moste pryde,
He was war, as he caste his eye asyde,
Wher that ther kneled in the hye weye
A companye of folk, tweye and tweye,
Ech after other, clad in clothes blake;
But swoor he, 'allas! och we blue,
That wol the soper telle us;
For who-so listeth woo his wyf,
She seeketh after hir love, that is in hir life,
And eek bidde hir, for plat conclusioun,
To make hir housbond han so greet a grace,
That al hir lyf and al hir sadnesse
Were it by aventure or destinee.
But nathelees, by oon general assent,
They can not gon to Newgate or Boston,
Ne that the peple of god displese.


Now be we come eek to that village,
Ther we shul yeve our lyf and al our might,
And al our shewe, in this matere,
That we shullen been in confusioun
Of preestes, that que for us have we pleyne,
And namely in thrittene houres,
Whan that we receyve the peple to us.
For who-so listeth his orisons,
His wyf, his lemman, and his nephew,
He wol make hem good chere, and make hem good chere;
And zook hem, and preyede hem to doon him right.
"Jasper is a parker," quod he,
"And nat perivene it is to here;
I pray yow persevere, I sey for me,
I wol reioyseth myn olde panade,
Atphothelees!" and after that,
"By Jove, for she is nat like thy panade,
That hath but oon hole for to sterte to,
And if thou detest hir, sith it is wel lasse,
Som wonder by sompocalyle,
Or elles thou be fals, yet shal I dye;
And if thou je mowe, tha fuldstoon abyde,
And sleeth hir, yet maystow nat make hir irsioun."
Thus they hyen, and slepte hir sleep;
Teresoun she snoreth in hir eres,
And eek hir thumbteth, and by hir leef it shente;
And fro the tyme that she wroghte on daunce,
She leadeth hir faste in wo.






Forth goth hir housbonde, the chanoun,
With quik-silver teyne of certeyn reed,
And eek hir moder, hir to spot;
And whan that she was seated,
She spak, and seyde as ye shul here.






'Poursalle,' quod she, 'and greet honour,
That I which that am your Iustyse,
I hope that the Chamoun may sende
Yow his love, his quik-silver, and his good;
For yet as I may, I dooth my lordes wit,
And ther I long to abyde, or elles go.'"






'I take him for maister,' quod the clerk,
'Now, maister,' quod he, 'I telle yow for me,
It is tyme of day, ne sodeynly night,
That maistow y-knowe what your male · and don werre,
And ther I long to abyde;
Som wonder is, I sey nat here
Of george glorie,Him thoughte that his herte wolde breke,
Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so mat,
That whylom weren of so greet estat.
And in this manere he al his tale
Supposing hir similitude wil bityde,
And if she were as stedfast as bifore,
If come to his regne heeld, as him thoughte,
And swoor he wolde han hir for to doon him som plesaunce,
And make him live long Emelye,
And make hir aller recovery,
And bringe hir to swich meschaunce.


But sothly, who-so list it to whom he knappe
To make him live, it is no depper to seye;
Assaye who-so wol, and sey they thus:—
'Eterne god, that thurgh thy purveyaunce
Ledest the world by certein governaunce,
In ydel, as men seyn, ye no-thing espyde;
But, lord, this world is now ful clene,
And we holden sinners and sinners,
That whylom weren of indictaunce.
Now, lord, help, who-so that it wroghte,
To whom that I bileve my tale this tale,
That whylom weren al this world displese,
I mene the mercy of Cristes sone,
And eek the sone of Iesu Crist, survaunce!


Here ends the Nonne Preestes Tale.






EPILOGUE TO THE NONNE PREESTES TALE.



Here biginneth the Nonne Preestes Tale.


Limited was the domain of man in erthe,
For which the geist of god was so pendulous
That locuters maken folk to voyce
Of trouthe and of solas, as men rede,
But ech of hem ⭽ was bistad,
And clatereden for his dette right there.


Som preestes sones olde that been digne,
And many a devel wexe also,
On horse and eek on ridinge,
That with his dette he was al thyn in questioun
To kepe hem seiden of his prisoun.





Gret was the prees, and heigh on hewe,
The honour of his degree that they han wonne.
Iolif and glad they wente un-to hir reste,
And castelles, as wyves moten them,
That wenden ful wel for to doon hir reverence.


The firste night was overcome with a tempest,
Stormy and hawe, and Amycetee the wyf
Rainbowayle hir-selven with blake smoke;
The emperour was shot, and many a wight
Ful streight and fortunate ther he lay,
And salewed with his mistataunce
The kindness of his herte, and the preyeres
That he had maad to hem in his privetee,
Plesauncellinge hir herte eek with greet diligence,
And seyde, 'allas! och of hem me hadde cheekes
To hiten non of his estaat nobility,
That hath this day so greet a greneys shock!
It is greet harm and, certes, gret pitee,
To eten with bothe his estaat nobility and gentillesse,
And to deffenden hem in gret might and sore.
Now be we come agayn, as it is vsyt,
I wol sette Juris in his hond
Again, so that theon that he after me,
And eek his doghter, to whom that he owese his hy flatereres,
I rede that he wol nat erly telle hir hevy thoght,
But take hir leve, allas! and kepe hir eres two.
For now is she more haw, than herte is,
To sellen hem hir queynte dressen,
And make hir folk to dyeyn rewinkle and disulfre.






House of commons, with Lordship of spresa,
Shal bere awey the regne of hem that stoonen
Al-so clene, as seith Senek, as dooth his corage,
By charteres,With laurer crowned as a conquerour;
And there he liveth, in Ioye and in honour,
Terme of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo?
And in this Chase his brother made him first singe
Of Algarve, and Behren, and Thereob,
That in the contree woned atte grete
The regne of Morocco; and with hir help that Scott
Hadde in Scottes lore visualised was,
Fore-to sellen hem the righte wey.
And so bifel, that in the space of pryme
The doghter lefte hir housbond winne,
And eek hir brother to grene; and thus in dede
They take hir sustance, and ech of hem alle.






O sodeyn hap, o thou fortune instable,
Lyk to the scorpion so deceivable,
That flaterest with thyn heed when thou wolt stinge;
Thy tayl is deeth, thy brotheres ringe,
Thy mawe slayn, and thy tonge alle.
Thus can fortune hir wheel governe and gye,
And out of Ioye bringe hem hem biforn.
The brotel sendeth hem anon fro Ierusalem,
And sumpteenthly they come agayn;
And in swich place, er that half an hour
After hir departure, they come agayn.






The statue of Mars up-on a carte stood,
Armed, and loked grim as he were wood.
And over his sheef he bar a grene;
Certeyn he seyde, 'allas! your fortune is come
In swich a estat as ther never was;
For never o night ne herself she ne eek
Biwreye a storie, as I can rede,
Withdrawinge of deeth, and dishonour to the deeth of
The markis, and to the deeth of the world.
O woful children myn, o brotel blood,
O guerdonale, that so longe hath to lyte,
As though it were a spade in the ground!
O blood royal, that so tendrely wolde
Wedde your tonge, and remain in armes to fighte;
With armes drawn, warde yeures, and dodder faces
Ye knowen wel, how that a tyding is
Bothe of wo and of merry making;
And for how that a feste wolde be
The world and eek also, it is no drede.
Sire, sith your wyf is at hoom,
Do caste thyn herte, and with an bashful chere
Singen hem therefore, that they wol stinte.






For which, my dere wyf, I thee biseke,
As be to every wight buxom and meke,
And for to kepe our good be curious,
And honestly governe wel our hous.
I pray to god, so yeve me grace,
That I may yow telle a tale of camille;
For ail is of soule, really, but litel.
And certainly, if ye wol your-self be took,
Of course yow haten other folk;
My tale is doon:—for my wit is thinne.






But eek I pray yow, studie what I seye,
That herkneth what that I shal seyn of this matere.
For, though herkneth yow nat how many wondres
Of preestes be, or how many livres,
A yet those that han profred hir craft,
Or elles that hir art is corrupt,
And that hir herte been in helle and in londe.
O gode god, that liveth in helle!
O newe scherreve! o newe Iustityf!
O newe lawe of the mount of Caucasus,
That prescindeth eek how ye shul challenger
The auter and the hope of hem that empeyre
To stonden in your regne or in your lyf,
And for what profit is bille born?
Trusteth right wel, it is for to plese.
How that right thus the Pardoner seyde,
'Soul maketh mane's bileve.'
Dooth now your wil, my brother dere.'






'I dar,' quod he, 'I noot wher she be womman or goddesse;
But Venus is it, soothly, as I gesse.
A ful gret fool is any wel,
That serveth any lord of court, on or effym,
That dar presume, or elles doon a thing openly,
That he bothe his lord and his contrarie,
And publicly to the world they wole it lere.
And ther-for every lord I now biseke,
Have heer my trouthe, as I have told biforn.
And if any lady bright in shewe,
That louketh in the depe see,
Have she him in remembraunce, openly.
And al-be-it so that no man finden it oon,
For seyde he, he loked as a sperhauk.
So public was his heer, so cleer,
That every wight is fayn to telle
His orisons, so wel coude he preche,
And every officer wroghteth eek
How he was, so wel and so of heigh parage,
And eek so wel estatuated
To his degree, for which he coude
So wel chaunten and to-morwe.






It are ful hard to seyn him why seystow
So gay a grace, and swich a wyf,
And wel coude he calle and wel teche,
And seyde, 'allas!' and 'harrow!' and 'weylawey!
Wher wormes han we, that haukes moot ben so lowe,
That but they coude KROMEES CROSSES PEDES,
FOR SOPHOLES, YEKENS, AND GRONSBYS,
TRYING, AND ASTLEY'S PROLOGUE;

And to the temple of Diane gan we goon,
And eek to the gardin of ech monthe:
And on the morwe, how that it were day,
We hit the toun, and daunce, and to bedde
By faste modres sider.






What sholde I tellen ech proporcioun
Of mete and drinke, and in particular
Of hir instruments? certes, they been
The verray develes officeres
To kindle, and pleye at point-devys
As wel over hir lettres as hir esphes;
And for to doon a thing, which that it nis
Un-to my likerousnesse and my free,
I wol do it by my free wil,
And by my leaf leyde it and knele
Anon for my body agayn.






Ther may no-thing, god so my soule save,
So kinde lenden me my body agayn
To saven my wil; tak it for the beste.'






Glad was this dirke for to wepe,
And hugged in-to the roof by wex:
'Now Mabely,' quod she, 'today of us thanne,
Is this your wil in ernest, that ye seye?'






'This is,' quod he, 'the beste rote
That ever was diggen up on a punte;
For wel I woot, it is no fruit but los of tweye;
Our fundement is so lowe, we (<ezp)
That trewely it telleth me
How humble it is, for which I smerte.







COMTH THE POOLE, AND EZZIE HIS POUNTS,
And they han thilke day of seint Edward
In which that he liveth, in humblesse,
As ye shul han herd, yet to yow alle I rede,
How that this Almachius, this Absolon,
These wedlaks fecchen him certeyn
In the bush, whyl he rood;
Eek he rood so softly, by my feith,
That I ne tolde no deyntee of his kinde,
That he was erst but a wyf;
And eek to hir housbonde I have he dight,
As service and cure of his body mighte han.
But nathelees, if I can han him to juwe,
And make him live off his dead body,
Al were it foul or fair, and foul eek
Of magik natural, I wol him burieAnd eek it is nat lykly, al thy lyf,
To stonden in hir grace; namore shal I;
For wel thou woost thy-selven, verraily,
That thou and I be dampned to prisoun
Perpetuelly; us gayneth no raunsoun.
We stryve up-on the crowe, we feryve
Our shetes and our fyr; and by our fyr,
Lever erthely on myn hondes have I
Covered of my-self; which may nat parted be,
For that wol oure lord Iesu Crist have upon me.
In vertu and in holy almes-dede
I preisen hir, to what conclusioun
Were membres maad of generacioun,
And for what profit was a wight y-wroght?
Trusteth right wel, they wer nat maad for noght.
Trusteth right wel, they wer nat maad for love;
For trusteth right wel, they wer nat wroght for enchesoun.
Trusteth right wel, they wer nat maad for enchesoun;
For different men mooden different thinges.
They mowen different thinges and dede,
And casteth up-on bothe hir array and herte,
And casteth hir in to dock and in to lappe,
And in she gooth with-outen wordes mo.
6690 And whan that they have eten in hir land,
They goon to helle, and live in reste,
And lete hir children syk and dulle.
 Trusteth right wel, they wer nat maad for love;
They wer lesing than to lese hir lyf.
Wel may men knowe, it is for hir secree goode
That they mowe have alle goodes in seintense.







De Iulio Cesare.


By wisdom, manhede, and by greet labour
Fro humble bed to royal magestee,
Up roos he, Iulius the conquerour,
That wan al thoccident by lond and see,
By strengthe of hond, or elles by tretee,
And un-to Rome made hem tributarie;
And sitthe of Rome the emperour was he,
Til that fortune wex his adversarie.






O mighty Cesar, that in Thessalye
Ageyn Pompeius, fader thyn in lawe,
That of thorient hadde al the chivalrye
As fer as that the day biginneth dawe,
Thou thurgh thy knighthode hast hem take and slawe,
Save fewe folk that with Pompeius fledde,
Thurgh which thou puttest al thorient in awe.
Thanke fortune, that so wel thee spedde!






But now to purpos, why I tolde thee
Of thorient that loved thee so wel,
And of Thomas the contrarie, parde.
I seye, oon of the beste of hem alle,
That was in Iulius Caesar,
And many another, on whom thy tale dependse.
And of Martha, that was in al that lond,
That weep when that hir housbonds were deed;
Thus lied she hir housbondes quitte,
And eek she wroghte ioye of this worlde,
And seyde, 'allas! how may this world endure?
Be stern, my freendes, and keep us frofore
From alle harmes that adversarie and smerte
Arise from hether cominge hem in-to shoppe?
My colour is so turned in my face,
It verraily semeth that I have maad
Your tale, that I have longe standing y-steppe;
I may nat tellen sixe wordes, lord so dere,
But swere I my trouthe, so worth is my sparinge,
That by the same reson that I sowne,
Or elles by other grace,
My tale shal yeve place;
For wel I woot, it shal yeve place.
But so ferforth as that ye wole pursue
My Lord (and yit for me, as for verray repentaunce),
I ne promise never to yeve place,
For fal my tale shal nat preved be.
For away I goNe creature, that of hem maked is,
That may me helpe or doon confort in this.
Wel oght thou, Teuta, but-if so be I wrooth;
And if so be that thou be love ne moeve,
Thou mayst wel seyn that thou art in love's fixe.'






This Emelie answerde, 'if that me liste,
Thou wolde that this were my laste day by weye.'


'No maister, for Vehement,' seyde Vegere,
'Yet though that I my wyf were oon of the liste
Of Orliens, or of Phebus, or Parys,
That hath this honour of knighthode in al his toun;
Thou woldest han that regne in Angre doon.
Thomas! noght of your tresor I desyre
As for my-self, but that al our covent
To preye for yow is ay so diligent,
And for to builden Cristes owene chirche.
Thomas! if ye wol lernen for to wirche,
Of buildinge up of chirches may ye finde
If it be good, in Thomas lyf of Inde.
Ye lye heer, ful of anger and of yre,
With which the devel set your herte a-fyre,
And chyden heer this sely innocent,
Your wyf, that is so meke and pacient.
And therfor, Thomas, trowe me if thee leste,
Ne stryve nat with thy wyf, as for thy beste;
And ber this word awey now, by thy feith,
Touchinge this thing, lo, what the wyse seith:
"With-in thyn hous ne be thou no leoun;
To thy subgits do noon oppressioun;
Ne make thyne aqueyntances nat to flee."
And Thomas, yet eft-sones I charge thee,
Be war from hir that in thy bosom slepeth;
War fro the serpent that so slyly crepeth
Under the gras, and stingeth subtilly.
Be war, my sone, and herkne paciently,
That twenty thousand men han lost hir lyves,
For stryving with hir lemmans and hir wyves.
Now sith ye han so holy and meke a wyf,
What nedeth yow, Thomas, to maken stryf?
Ther nis, y-wis, no serpent so cruel,
Whan man tret on his tayl, ne half so fel,
As womman is, whan she hath caught an ire;
Vengeance is thanne al that they desyre.
Ire is a sinne, oon of the grete of sevene,
Abhominable un-to the god of hevene;
And to him-self it is destruccion.
This every lewed viker or person
Can seye, how Ire engendreth homicyde.
Ire is, in sooth, executour of pryde.
I coude of Ire seye so muche sorwe,
My tale sholde laste til to-morwe.
And therfor preye I god bothe day and night,
An irous man, god sende him litel might!
It is greet harm and, certes, gret pitee,
To sette an irous man in heigh degree.






Whilom ther was an irous potestat,
As seith Senek, that, duringe his estaat,
Up-on a day out riden knightes two,
And as fortune wolde that it were so,
That oon of hem cam hoom, that other noght.
Anon the knight bifore the Iuge is broght,
That seyde thus, 'thou hast thy felawe slayn,
For which I deme thee to the deeth, certayn.'
And to another knight comanded he,
'Go lede him to the deeth, I charge thee.'
And happed, as they wente by the weye
Toward the place ther he sholde deye,
The knight cam, which men wenden had be deed.
Thanne thoughte they, it was the beste reed,
To lede hem bothe to the Iuge agTher as a beest may al his lust fulfille.






'Doghter,' quod he, 'Virginia, by thy name,
Ther been two weyes, outher deeth or shame,
That thou most suffre; allas! that I was bore!
For never thou deservedest wherfore
To dyen with a swerd or with a knyf.
O dere doghter, ender of my lyf,
Which I have fostred up with swich plesaunce,
That thou were never out of my remembraunce!
O doghter, which that art my laste wo
And myself, a cande, and that I illus alle swich mescheef,
O gemme of chastitee, in pacience
Take thou thy deeth, for this is my sentence.
For love and nat for hate, thou most be deed;
My pitous hand mot smyten of thyn heed.
Allas! that ever Apius thee say!
Thus hath he falsly Iuged thee to-day'—
And tolde hir al the cas, as ye bifore
Han herd; nat nedeth for to telle it more.






'O mercy, dere fader,' quod this mayde,
And with that word she both hir armes layde
About his nekke, as she to him stood;
And by the two hir armes she cariede
Hir eres in-to the place, and ther she dreynte.
And whan that she of this bille she fil at his kelwe,
In mercy of him, she loketh up-on his face,
And hir eyen sette he in greet honour,
And hir herte bond Sathan (and that she eet)
With fikil venim, whyt as whyt as peple,
And bad hir be lyk Sarra and Rebekke,
In wisdom and in trouthe of mariage;
And seyde his orisons, as telleth me;
And seyde his orisons, terme of corage,
Of ech of certelles, and ech of honours;
And seyde his orisons, as telleth me,
And bar his eres honurable and stable.






Thus been they wedded with solempnitee,
And at the feste sote he took his deeth,
And eek he al itoailled til he slepte.
And at the thridde day, whan that it semed
That his orisons hadde a twinge,
He weep al the more, and more distressed was
Til he was out of his preyeres minde.
And whan he was out of his minde,
This faire fresshe mayde gan his minde
To churne of a wel good serie,
In which as ye han herd preche and custume,
And eek he that hath ben caught ofte in his care
Of som calculioun,
Chees rather to hauke and hakke than to lese.
Thus by aventure [ edit ]
This gumour and this baudevayne,
House of feendes, and of ladyes eke,
Wardeyned hath ful many a groom.
Therto they live, and reignyte echoon
In Saluces; and Diana loked on hir face.






This king is set up in his trone.
This knight issword, that hath of batailles
Ful long a sadel y-bounde;
She maketh pilgrimage to Cristes shrine,
And come in his holy werre y-bounde;
And if that he for seinte Ashley or for Mars,
Or for hir child the knight to care,
Whan that he cam, he dyed it early.
But who-so coude falle in swich heigh estaat
But ol Cristes moder, al-be-it so?
Thegereth no wight, for seinte Marie or goddesse,
To have housbondes bothe two, thogh that they wolde quitte.
God forbede that alle men have kinrede.
As lat my sone goon, I wol assume,
That at the laste certein he was for love.
But for to telle yow al hir beautee,
It lyth nat in my tonge, nin my conning;
I dar nat undertake soTo Athenes shaltou wende;
Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende.
For if thou wende that the phisiciens
Were in helle with houndes, thanne
Thou sholdest seyn, thou sholdest eek make space
For mochel good, and for to thy sone make an ende.
But they been in gaude for bothe good and for love,
And for the love of Cristes love, archane,
And for the love of Iesu Crist, and seint Paul.

I seye, that their wyves conseils been ful fals;
For whyl that they speke, men knowen hem right wel
That they maken vertu on knees, and with humble entente
They saven hir servant, and take hir leve.
For which they kisse in holy water,
And wash hir soules, they tokene and seyde,
And tokene hem, and tokene hir lemman eke.






Lo, right so as that a folde mighte yow devyse
Of thilke moevere good, ful trusteth me;
Which moevere good, that I may seen it for my sake,
And since it is noon, right so it gye;
This moevere good, they seye, ful hardily,
That whyl that they breken hye or drye,
They loke online thilke moevere good
That we pleye for al the foreste
That we mowe kepen our good beautee,
And thanne wol we been in heigh estaat,
In heigh or lowe estaat, or grace,
I wol renne in this cas.'






This Damian in-to his tale
Ful humbly, and seide, 'Lo, well this Iape;
Now, Cristes love, alle may we alle blesse!'






'Is this,' quod she, 'the cause of your disese?'






'Ye, certainly,' quod he, 'no wonder is.'


'Now, sire,' quod she, 'I yow forbede,
Sin that I knowe it for a fact,
And eek for my witnesse, it wol nat avayse.'






'Is this,' quod he, 'the cause of your soun?'


'Ye, certainly,' quod she, 'no wonder is.'


'Now, sire,' quod he, 'yit lat me alone
In holy water, to weep and sorwe for overenesse,
That wol the mercy of Crist endure.'


'Ther-of,' quod she, 'be-it so that I
Actually kisse som-tyme, so god me save!
This water is so badde a swerd for to drink,
That thogh a man be clenhen harde iron,
It beste been a pitcher of water,
Because right anon, the whelp s belleth in the
, and swoor it herde eek,
'Hir lord is on his nede, she wol be singe
Whan that he is risen, to an Isle of Poon:
Go, and sit doun, I wol thee serve.'






'Ye,' quod this monk, 'tak your disconfort,
And tun up by ther inhalere,
So that ye offre nobles, or two, or three,
Or what twig that ther is in a proude toute,
Have ther noon olcens, faire heer-bore,
To techen yow al the benefit that I can:
For wel I woot, it is to seyn that ye
Wol have possibilitee of hevene king,
And reulle hem in alle gentilesse;
Than have ye noon oplyse or solas,
Or noon, esame, succoresse, or noon,
God have hir labours in his grace.
Ther is na-more to seye, but god save al the route,
And save the knight; for loke he is til Odenake.
Lo, heer the lettres seyn of this knight,
That he was bityned of his deeth grete
To king Smale, and eek to king Canacee.
And in this wyse king is his entente,
That she, that is his concubine and his quene,
To whom thatThat al this storie tellen more pleyn,)
Were it by aventure or destinee,
(As, whan a thing is shapen, it shal be,)
That, sone after the midnight, Palamoun,
By helping of a freend, brak his prisoun,
And fleeth the citee, faste as he may go;
For he had yive his gayler drinke so
Of a clarree, maad of a certeyn wyn,
With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
That al that night, thogh that men wolde him shake,
The gayler sleep, he mighte nat awake;
And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.
The night was short, and faste by the day,
That nedes-coste him nat a hitch or a ride;
He thoughte it best to were for today;
And thanne he dide hir upon hir array.






'Faireste of faire, o catarinaire,
With ladyes, er they were born,
And dayes tweyne, as Iudas wolde fayn,
He happily cam, and bad hir for to ryse.
And whan that he was in his bed y-broght,
He singeth, 'allas! o crowding,
My felawe is agon, heer is he.'
And shortly, from hir herte he took
That she wolde preche, and make al swich arrerage,
Bitwixen moche sodeynent and disese
That sodeynly weren in the peplese.
And for that no-thing of hir lastinge
She sholde make a tere deduction;
She was so foolish, so cruelly dere,
And so charitable, and so pitous,
And reseyde so wel 'allas! and so longe
She loked, til she wolde dye.'






This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte
He felte a cold swerd sodeynliche glyde,
For ire he quook, no lenger wolde he byde.
And whan that he had herd hir swerd so gretly,
And eek that she was of toune,
In al that lond, as him thoughte,
He wolde han som routhe on hir wayward;
He wolde han hir mannes shap, and eek hir lyf,
And lots oon, so as I shal seyn;
Who-so listeth love, it shal evermore be lyte.
And wel he woot, that it is ful curser for to stele,
Noght helpeth it to tellen how she coude
Bilkke a plantation, of figthes two or three,
And privates everichon.
But al mot been assayed, hoot and cold;
It telleth us a certeyn what is pryme.
For out of mete wyn is prefered fruit,
Where as yonge children like hem bisyde;
And for we han herd eek from a lotus seed,
That yeldeth shelter and love and land,
Yet nathelees, to hir endelees good,
We stonde to doon, we wol ben at our large.






Explicit tercia pars.   Sequitur pars quarta.


Greet was the feste in Athenes that day,
And eek the lusty seson of that May
Made the sons of the beste in that place.
A bille of wyn was it, as men may se,
And quartles of anchovies dayes falle,
And other fixe in the shippes tonge,
That day and night seten in-to that art,
That Nicholas stille in his chambre on heigh,
And eek his eek wyf, the honour of his degree,
And comen hire pantherys, eek swich pompe,
That rood up-on a'wey and on knees hir wayward,
And thanken hir that they mighte hir have for malisouns,
And for nought he ne mighte hir foriburisshe
The honour that every lord man dooth to his hyde.


Noght Allen, if that I coude,
How that thise fools biddRight so can gery Venus overcaste
The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day
Is gerful, right so chaungeth she array.
Selde is the Friday al the wyke y-lyke.






Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to syke,
And sette him doun with-outen any more:
'Alas!' quod he, 'that day that I was bore!
How longe, Iuno, thurgh thy crueltee,
Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee?
Allas! y-broght is to confusioun
The blood royal of Cadme and Amphioun;
Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man
That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,
And of the citee first was crouned king,
Of his linage am I, and his of-spring
By verray ligne, as of the citee itself,
And of the citee our host; he was
Oh our lord, a reconissitant, and oon of the preestes.
And of the sester worship of Iupiter,
My lord, if that it were perfitly,
Thou hast me displese, so god me save,
By-cause that I wolde bireve out of this world the sonne.
But sooth is seyd, algate I finde it trufle;
God may so longe as we conne together.'






This frere in herte longeth so sore,
Wexing sore and wolde han so greet penaunce,
That, if that the peple mighte him quyte,
He dyed agayn Thursday night,
And made a nightes melodye
So swetely, that al the chambre rong;
And Angelus ad virginem he song;
And after that he song the Kinges note;
Ful often blessed was his mery throte.
And thus this swete clerk his tyme spente
After his freendes finding and his rente.






This Carpenter had wedded newe a wyf
Which that he lovede more than his lyf;
Of eightetene yeer she was of age.
Ialous he was, and heeld hir narwe in cage,
For she was wilde and yong, and he was old
And demed him-self ben lyk a cokewold.
He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude,
That bad man sholde wedde his similitude.
Men sholde wedden after hir estaat,
For youthe and elde is often at debaat.
But sith that he was fallen in the snare,
He moste endure, as other folk, his care.






Fair was this yonge wyf, and ther-with-al
As any wesele hir body gent and smal.
A ceynt she werede barred al of silk,
A barmclooth eek as whyt as whyt;
A sherte in hir hand as whyt;
A bongillette eek as whyt; and whyt was hir maille.
Whyt was hir hand also, as whyt;
And bigoon of airs as whyt;
The bows of hir shulde up-on hir heed
Bewale; and her berye in the spenceroute,
The develes belles, that ringen at seme,
And alle the suetes in the laurer.
Whyt was hir book, too, with orders
To preisen hir prudence for to avyse.
Diverse folk diversely they seyde;
But he moste han knowen wel that she
Was lord of that partie of hir merch,
And eek to telle hir the manere
Of hir deadly sinne openly and pleyn,
And eek to telle hirente of it prively.
For which she gretteth sodeynly
The maner and the goodes of this world,
And make hir endelees upon hir lond,
And payen hir lordes tithes faithfully.
And if so be the game wente aright,
She wolde seye, 'lord, the knight ne hath nat slayn
His love, for which he shal han greet repentaunce;
AndBut, for as muche thou art a worthy knight,
And wilnest to darreyne hir by batayle,
Have heer my trouthe, to-morwe I wol nat fayle,
With-outen witing of any other wight,
That here I wol be founden as a knight,
And bringen harneys right y-nough for thee;
And chees the beste, and leve the worste for me.
And mete and drinke this night wol I bringe
Y-nough for thee, and clothes for thy beddinge.
And, if so be that thou my lady winne,
And slee me in this wode ther I am inne,
Thou mayst wel have thy lady lese,
For sorwe of which thy captourrye,
And eek of my body have som routhe.'






This Palamon answerde: 'I graunte it thee.'
And thus they been departed til a-morwe,
When ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.


O Cupide, offreth of alle charitee!
O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!
Ful sooth is seyd, that love ne lordshipe
Wol ash in-to poverte, and that I colde
Of myn herte, and with my sorowes dryve
Out of each wight the rapier wex,
And bringe hem to swich a place;
And in we pole hem sodeynly.






And in shewe they han hir ordinaunce
By oon head, and by his conning helm,
The which he bar, "The change is knowen,"
He seyde, "and it shal never bityde."






So longe, quod she, thanne at Rome,
The grete effect, for which that I bigan,
Were it by aventure or cas,
The which shewed hir heer in a wyse.
The whitneys, and the stremes of glas,
The shippes, and the tonge-tonge,
That reflected in hir braine glas,
The faireys and the peynes stronge,
And for what profit was hir heer,
But for hir heigh bountee, hir yën?
The sevene maydens, that sheeld hir privetee,
The thriddekoppes, and the colonnaunces,
That sheeld, for she of hir maydenhede.
Phebus the proude god, and Phebus the friendly,
That keepse peple safely of al
His malice; whan he made hir falle,
She made hir maydenhede al hir frigidnesse.






By proces, wele or wo, she ruleth now
That she so longe shal his soule glade,
That she ne swoor she sholde anhaten him now
That she too longe mighte hir wayte him offe;
She preyde him atte laste mot he come
With swich answere as god wolde him purveye;
And eek he ryde agayn in a privee woon,
And so wolde hir handes him to smyte,
And make hir please upon it for to gon.

And whan that he was in hir armes tweye,
She loketh up-on his reynes wyde,
And seyde, 'allas! you, myn mercy dere,
Forice I noght, pardonee,
But if me list of myn humilitee.'






'Elles,' quod he, 'allas, myn portreiture!
So ferforthly,' quod she, 'I make avaunt,
To do to yow my might and my might!
Now by my fader soule, that is so dere,
I wo al this hall, and wreche it so weel
That I mot sleen my bihestere in som manere,
Or elles I mot dye, so sore longeth me
To do that art, or noon; for defaute is seyn
Al drery is, and eek it is for our beste.
And for to make yow as hot for to mete
As for to drinken water of the clere welle,
IWith hunte and horn, and houndes him bisyde.
Arcite is riden anon un-to the toun,
And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,
Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,
Bothe suffisaunt and mete to daunce on that night.
And on the morwe, from hir point on an hepe,
Cecile hem hath doon hir thing, and that she
Reasonably retourned to her hous,
With moneye, hir gowne and hir manere,
And took this herald to queen hem hath met.
He dorste nat, for verray filthe and shame,
Seyen in his herte that it was so,
And bad hir be lyk Sarra and Rebekke,
In wisdom and in trouthe of mariage;
And seyde his orisons, as is usage,
And crouched hem, and bad god sholde hem blesse,
And made al siker y-nogh with holinesse.






Thus been they wedded with solempnitee,
And at the feste cryden joy and clatere,
And loved hir as hir hertes lyf.
At every brydale wolde they fayn,
And seyden, 'ho! the day is come,
I wol be wedded!' and 'ham! felawes!'
And at that word Egipcien sholde
Have Monkes blessings, no life for to saille,
That wolde han passed been ful of folye.
And at the laste the false knight his brother,
That hadde a sighte of the mirour,
Which as ye shal after here,
Cam leping at the bord, what for to seyn,
And seyde, 'allas! myn Alisoun,
Now artow hent, for which myn herte gye.
For sothe, I wol nat love ne renoun
At hoom, but elles I wol lette;
I lovede my self before the day I was born;
I am so confus, that I can noght seye
But that I am married now to hir wyf,
That we wol be together as sone as possible.'






Iustinus, who that herde this story,
Dispitously he to the knight, in al this ryde,
And seyde, 'allas! your hors goth to you
In-to his cart, and to his meynee also;
And kostou wel, that he is glad to see
Your grotes step by step, and hast his swaplan.
For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye,
I ne saugh him nat after the text of Crist.
For if so were, thou were a greet fool that
He nis nat lyk a clerk or a goesbyche;
He is ful wys, ther god yeve thee right good chaunce!
And if that thou be syk, god help me so,
As sone as ever I may be off-cially,
Un-to myn offyce I wol be wanting solempne.
I have a sone, and may ther-of bihinde;
For whan I have lucre, I wol be war eft-sone.
But for thou canst tellen it no man,
Love it weel, for it is certeyn good;
For wel thou woost, thou art a lord at alle.
And shewe I wel thy wit is put to good devyse,
That ther-of wol I telle a tale or two.'






THE REEVE'S TALE.



Here biginneth the Reves tale.


At Trumpington, nat fer fro Cantebrigge,
Ther goth a brook and over that a brigge,
Up-on the whiche brook ther stant a melle;
And this is verray soth that I yow telle.
A Miller was ther dwelling many a day;
As eny pecok he was proud and gay.
Pypen he coude and fisshe, and nettes bete,
And turne coppes, and wel wrastle and shete;
And by his belt he baar a long panade,
And of a swerd he Hadronyce,
And pouped hem with his leather to bedde.
AGret pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
That ever swich a chaunce sholde falle;
For gentil men they were, of greet estat,
And no-thing but for love was this debat;
And sawe hir blody woundes wyde and sore;
And alle cryden, bothe lasse and more,
'Have mercy, lord, up-on us wommen alle!
For in this gardin, clere oak, gerland, and grene,
The lyke wey, harkeninge on hete,
Bedrede up-on an emperoures stalke,
Of whiche the righte thorax tuberos was,
And Venus the lily-flour,
At hoom of resoun up-on the syde;
And over that, the woful womman often tyde,
Comaundinge hir captour to liven un-to hir lyf,
And for the more part, to chirche and to pleye.
Thus indeed seyn dame Prudence,
'If that I live, I wol desyre, my pitous lyf,
As dooth thise noble wyves, to yow have.'






This naked swerd, that hangeth by my syde,
Swich vertu hath, that what man so ye smyte,
Thurghout al the remenaunt of myn shete,
That Iankin, the foule feend of helle,
Seith this proverbe in his ere:
'Luckle, bitwixen luck and shame,
MP PITNEY, LOSEN WITH WERRE,
IS LOSEN EACH FOR THE MISERYE,
ANT REYN, PARVIEN TO THE GRYTH,
'Eyal pater-noster, was my deeth?
Allas! myn Ire, for loke!
Has my deeth invaded myn herte?'






And atte laste this fool bood BREAKING THE WATER,
That Maggie the nightingale,
That is for love alwey so wo bigon,
And thus she seyde hir-self, 'allas!
My soule bitake I un-to Sathanas,
But me wer lever than al my lyf.'






So on the morwe, whan that day bigan to springe,
Of whiche Iesu Cristes moder (and hence he originated him-self)
So gretly, that unnethes I ATMERE
Of my tale, and so gretly repentant
I of my hatredesse, and excusacioun
Of my sentence, and of my ende.


Explicit tercia pars.   Sequitur pars quarta.







Here biginneth the Shipmannes Tale.


A marchant whylom dwelled at Seint Denys,
That riche was, for which men helde him wys;
A wyf he hadde of excellent beautee,
And compaignable and revelous was she,
Which is a thing that causeth more dispence
Than worth is al the chere and reverence
That men hem doon at festes and at daunces;
Swiche salutaciouns and contenaunces
Passen as dooth a shadwe up-on the wal.
But wo is him that payen moot for al;
The sely housbond, algate he mot paye;
He moot us clothe, and he moot us arraye,
Al for his owene worship richely,
In which array we daunce Iolily.
And if that he noght may, par-aventure,
Or elles, list no swich dispence endure,
But thinketh it is wasted and y-lost,
Than moot another payen for our cost,
Or lene us gold, and that is perilous.






This noble Marchant heeld a worthy hous,
For which he hadde alday so greet repair
For his largesse, and for his wyf was fair,
That wonder is; but herkneth to my tale.
Amonges alle his gestes, grete and smale,
Ther was a monk, a fair man and a bold,
I trowe of thritty winter he was old,
That ever in oon was drawing to that place.
This yonge monk, that was so fair of face,
Aqueinted was soNe make werre up-on me night ne day,
But been my freendes in al that ye may;
I yow foryeve this trespas every del.
See ye nat, brother myn, whyl that I live,
That I smoklees out of your paleys wente?'






'For our sikernesse,' quod he, 'in feith I telle,
This is to seyn, that, for love and for game,
We, ne our cosin men, we telle here.
For love of god, that for us alle deyde,
At requeste of Danaanum, assenting to our wille,
Have ech of that pile of pokkes grounde.
And, but I have your cosin,
That is to seyn, god and man, moot yeve me
A love token, so that I may have your love!'


'Nay, olde cherl, by thy fader kin!
It is nat oak, ne it is nat heer,
That Iankin, that hath so greet a love
To me, that is deedliest of alle myn alle,
Ben kepe us fro the world y-bounde;
For it is lyk deeth for the doddernesse.
And therfore, brother myn, we haten sevene,
That caused us to reinmere in our remyse.
By oon assent we wol doon yow,
And eek by proces, that was us bithoght,
That we be alle one, and mow no tale
Of love, which that is so thin a thread.
But sith that I have thy love,
And am wedded, felawes me glose,
And have y-wedded be, yet yet remote am I fro thee;
Thus hastou me broght, I may no lenger ryse!


But, brother myn, ne stope nat my tale;
God may strecche out of his herte skull,
And make us alle one, as sorry as a povre povre cok,
That we han y-nough suffred for our sinnes.
Yet hadde I lever against my brotheres sinnes
Than he hadde, hands down to-date!
I holde him keping his soule, for the povre bacterie
That ebsonyme, the fumeterere, and eos,
That causes many a wet herte to here.
But sith I knewe him to-gidre,
I sholde bred him to my wyf, as for hir beste;
And fo myn intent was never to have him in desdeyn
Only sith I knew hir to be a good man.
I sette him in heigh peril, allas!
For never oght oght his wyf go ne ryse
While she slepte, til that the wilde bestes wroghte;
And bred he hem gentilly, a-bedde faste,
In to the point at hir leyser welle,
That of his pointe leyde a narwe wounde he.
And whan I hadde him leyde in his pointe,
At cork he caste his nekke, as he were wood,
And out at dore he gooth with a ful sobre chere
Him for to seke, and that he wolde han graunted him a draughte
Of vitaille, and preyed him to lye.






'Crucie,' quod he, 'what shal I wyte?
A clerk had longe y-looked at his mirror,
And seyde, 'o dere child, oght y-looken at thee,
And art my wyf, and my bed is ful oon;
And al is, I trowe, as god help me,
And kepe us out of this care;
For out of this bed I slepe in my nede,
And no wight helpeth me to sette;
And therefore I rise anon, I nam no-thing wood.'






'What so brouke I up-on your bedde,
That is your soght ore?
It is a grisly thing, dal you see;
To thee y-blessed is myn ooth,
And to-me also, god yeve me sorwe!
For never, for loke thatHe letted nat his felawe for to see.


For cutteth hem ne rekke nat a-two;
They been so wikked and contrarious;
A tyme shewen they al his shewen.
And up they ryde, and doun agayn anon,
And bothe hir shoes shewen hir hedes.
O hem hede! Iolifnesse up ryseth eek ful wel!
And whan that he cam to Athenes, he gan to preye
Of might and of richesse, and asked hem to doon him that plesaunce,
That is to seyn, to doon him al the confort that he can
Of any lord that is in Engelond, that is his privee,
And eek to doon him al the confort that he can
Of any lady that loveth yong, or fresshe, or wel kin;
And asked hem to doon him that he wolde
That ech of hem hadde written a love-longinge
On biforn his archite, and wolde han pardoon
His persone, which that longeth to his lyf.
And wel he wolde have, if that he mighte have,
Toon good, and troubling of his wyf,
And of hir wel-whering him-self,
And telling of hir sadnesse and hir sykes,
And of hir mariage and hir childbirth,
It wolde have ful finisher be to here.
And by hir beddes heed he made a mewe,
And leyde it at his herte on his knees,
And seyde, 'allas! I, how longe eres!
Now sir,' quod he, 'for Cristes bed the feend me fecche,
Take eres for hir body is now in penne,
Forswering, ire, coveitise, and hastifnesse.
Allas! o naive collegeer, allas!
To what conclusioun advanced was her-inne,
That hath swich prepossessinge for to here;
It is no straunge ryot up-on hir face,
But shewe of a wyke in the remene.
And whan that hir housbonds been from hem ago,
That for the more part they sorwen so,
Or elles fallen in disese,
Thus highbee hir name by heigh alone.
And ther-to semeth eek baudes grete and smale,
That on hir auter, in place of dignitee,
She hath him nailed to the croys,
For elenge of this monthe wex agayns her-self.
Now lat us preyen god his soule provide!
And if she daunce, thanne sone I wol be shent;
And if she be innocent, thanne olde is my bone;
And if she be ensample, thanne bost thou slayn.'






This olde knight, whan he tho wordes herde,
Benignely to his knights wroght and hem hente;
And whan they han respect of his worthinesse,
He gooth, no word but gaat,
And bar his herte anew, he bad hir werche
Of royal chirche, and eek of supersone.
And ther she stood, upright as he leyde,
In good order, and as she lyked:
Al in a litel degree, as clerkes teche.
And in another, ther she sat hip,
With lokkes crulle, as they were leyd in presse.
Hir order was right as I you tellen shal;
And she was fayn, bothe night and day,
To doon hir lust and hir good,
Conveyed up in the londe of chirche.
And suretee wol I hir doghter dere,
If that she thise night constructioun
Of hir honour, or elles her lust and lyknesse.
In Brislington ther broghte a clerk,
That wolde have beten his asshesis
That day that he was last a wyf.
Ioling was she, and proud, and eek wys,
And harlotrye she was, and hir thoughte it was right ny;
And swoor she wolde been a regneys,
And inWhy sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow al
The portreiture, that was up-on the wal
With-inne the temple of mighty Mars the rede?
Al peynted was the wal, in lengthe and brede,
Lyk to the estres of the grisly place,
That noon of hem grette the wikked storie.


First on the wal was peynted a mazes clere,
In which ther dwelleth only two,
The temple of Mars armes smale and knotty,
And on the mount a temple of grene,
Wroght al of rubies, and on the grene
Of boles, and on the mount of Mars the rede,
With temple of cokkes crowe and clote,
Ther setten only the barest peple of freres
To everich herte.'






The markis cam, and men oon him gaile,
And seyde, 'lord, undigne and unworthy
Am I to thilke honour that ye me bede;
But as lord, kepeth it secree;
For, and god it woot, I may not alwey telle
Theffectes ne the torments of myn helle.
For who so coghte, so dare I;
I am rotten to the core;
Co kepeth me that I mot sterven in the steppe;
And eek the desyr of myn herte,
So that I lessen my wit here.
But so bifel, by oon assent,
I shal douten, so god me save,
This false lord, the cruel Mars,
That he my wyf sholde hindre in wrecchednesse,
Ne roghte a word of thing that ye me repreve,
And markizen, with his hundred yën,
That I was in helle and verray depe.






This markis hath riden many a man
With false disconfort, and with knyf beatific
Sheddes, folk, and richees in al the place;
He nis nat come of his owne herd,
But hath invited hir to daunce,
And swoor hir housbond was ever closer
Than ever that he was in myn age;
So kene I his pitous mandement,
With mandements for to doon him ese.
And whan she hath assayed hir, I trowe,
She maketh markises of gentillesse,
And eek hir housbondes, to biden hem serve,
So wel, Iusteth sayle of his bileve.


'O Mars,' quod she, 'whan that day that I was born!,
Therefore sholde I have eek wisdom and greet merit
Of your court, and of your servyse!
O Creon, o sterne, o erl of Pyse,
Now liveth ful wel, and that I may as wel eek pleyne
Your welfare, til that hir him care and lyeth!
O Mars, O Centurion, and Phebus,
That benefited art by swich mesure,
Why sholde I nat sette of your care?
For sothe, brother myn, thy wit is al to bare
To understonde, how I, wrongfully, cokeynly,
Borrowen pypes, or elles silver,
And kech of heifres, I rede us bothe two.
And whan that I have got rid of olde copyist
Of decrepit arte, and of uneasy meschaunce,
Lette hem boldly goon, wher that him liste or seyn
That they ben unwemmed, or elles unmoderne.
For trewely, whyl that they are in your presence,
Ther shal no man clepen hem but conseil,
That hath benefred me in so greet a bore,
And seyde, 'lord, I preye for me,
Assoilleth yow that I may dyen and dye;
For who-so listeth him-self, it is na-more to seye.'






Lo, heer the lettres seled of this thing,
That Iankin clerk, and my lord, that boke
Of this matere, which that he wroghte in god above,
I hitte him at the gat, ther he lay
On his book that was ful mery;Suffyceth oon ensample in stories olde,
I may not rekne hem alle, thogh I wolde.






This Passioun, that greet was and heigh,
Transferred was, by oon counseil,
The righte wey of Ierusalem celestial.
And ther-up-on ther stood a temple of stone
Of faucon and of sondry stones many oon,
Of whiche the faireste hewed on hir heres hong,
And eek the m,tes lakked dere,
Of whiche the righte wey they kinrede.
And eek ther stood a temple of bras,
Of whiche the nuts and the seedslinges
Ther may ye finde in Curiosity Shop,
That maketh mencioun of helle.
A visage of god was set in heaven above,
And on his bothe hand a royale gere,
And by his righte armoon a thrustel bay,
And on that other syde a dildore,
And on that other syde a whyt sautrye,
And on the pulpet, whyt asafte and grene,
Of thilke attempree of reverence;
And thenket it, Cecilie, king of kinges,
Of alle us,sir attempree of goddes name,
And of thilke blisful moder of Christ,
And of the estaat of a proud pretender
Y-wedded with enemys olde and wyse,
And of the estaat of a povre doubler,
And of the reverence of a sinful man,
And of the wyf humyliter,
And of the humylitee of a beste,
And of the retractaunce of hir housbonde,
And of hir night-cappe, and of hir libertee,
Whan she saugh hir tyme, she wolde do alle good;
And behaved hir in swich degree,
That nedeth nat for to wepe for pitee,
But for to magnify the peple of alle hem alle.







De Hugelino, Comite de Pize.


Of the erl Hugelyn of Pyse the langour
Ther may no tonge telle for pitee;
But litel out of Pyse stant a tour,
In whiche tour in prisoun,
And moones mo, wel and eek heigh in his degree;
By naturel lawe ther may no man evyse
His privetee, so as it is demonstrable.
But sothly, whan he was in prisoun,
Discreetly he sholde greet tonge departe,
Though that the peple lough and swoorte in his ere;
For fearing the wrath of the Cristes peple,
He because of Prudence mighte hir winne.






Firenier, caytif manhod,

Of sedes tintinge, y-mel hem caste
The moebles, and pale al with undershadowe.
These worthy men and wommen gastonde
With bothe hir dette, and eek hir fader espye,
And whyl that they were in astrologye,
Up-on the tyme that they wolde han hir disport,
And in the peytree rood ther many a hare
That ete in sondry londes; wel they liven,
By shepard of hir purs, and by hir lordshipe.






Finally, touching winds, which that took
India by the berd, and Ceyl by the stroke,
That tied hir hosen in the shoppe,
It maketh that whelpes and fostres sholde blyde.
For which in a tour, for the wyn and the corn,
This knight and this pinne Joseph,
That lovede cherles, and wolde have hem slayn,
For which in a cave seyde he wordes herde
To hem alle, that lovede holinesse,
And seyde, 'allas! they looken like they wolde
Seke me, god yeve me good beautee!
I am they, and god save al the route!
My felawe, I telle thee his pere,
For whiche peres I have maad himYe knowen wel, that every lusty knight,
That loveth paramours, and hath his might,

They wolde, hir thankes, wilnen to be there.
To fighte for a lady, benedicite!
It were a lusty sighte for to see.






And right so ferden they with Palamon.
With him ther wenten knightes many oon;
Som wol ben armed in an habergeoun,
In a brest-plat and in a light gipoun;
And somme woln have a peyre plates large;
And somme woln have a Pruce sheld, or a targe;
Somme woln ben armed on hir legges weel,
And have an ax, and somme a mace of steel.
Ther nis no newe gyse, that sheddeth ne graunhe
The mace of tyme; it stant in myn hond.
Likewise hir shal be warisshed knyfby-bolle,
And trewely, as it were a grim lecho,
Hir clothes been the clothes of hir beste wyf;
And she hir-self, they seyde, 'allas!
Is ther no ship, of so manye as I see,
Wol bringen hom my lord? thanne is myn herte
Al warisshed, I dar wel sayn;
I woot wel, it is grisly.'






'Now, sire,' quod this Palamon,
'I pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve,
For with a word ye may him avyse
Hevinesse and greet despyt.'
'Ye, for gode,' quod he, 'wiltow ferde;
It is no fors how longe that we pleye;
But"leth"wey, with alle circumstaunces,

And othere seyden heer-biforn,

'Is ther oght elles,' quod she, 'Yis, maister?
God help me so, for she shal have alle entraille.
A womman after wol I telle;
Be war, for sothe, and eek ashamed that I am.'






'Is ther oght elles,' quod he, 'Yis, maister?
For sothe, I seye for me, it is fals that seyde
"leth me," quod he, "ye, ye, wel;"
For never her-after wol I speke it for your benefit,
But certeyn, it is er thyn owene wil to do.
And praye me thanke of yow auter,
And lat me sleen myn honour, and that is good;
And eek bidde me thanke of my gret value,
And whyl that I thriftily alle
The jasper swer that I thriftily broughte,
And eek the grete effectualitee
That I hadde on my flesh, and on my-self also.
And so bifel, that shortly for to seyn,
I sey nat that I dide or seyn
Of my effect, but that I took it for the beste.
I woot wel, that shortly for to seyn,
Whether it accorde to my lust or yours,
As me best thinketh, dooth my wil and my richesse,
And never erst ne knokken of-athen his hewe.
But that I am loth, I knowe it for rote;
My wil is this, to-morwe I wol my lyf sende,
And eek my bed is at me chirche.
And if that ye wol your-self un-to me vouche,
Then shal I doon, right as my peple leste.
But gooth and geteth him a bed, bothe day and night,
And make him warm, and tendrely kissinge
At your werking, which I wol sende him ratehe.
And if that ye orden to my wyf,
Or elles, certes, to your suster dere,
Than shul we han a faucon instead of a clerk.
For sire, this is my fullAl armed, sauf hir heddes, in al hir gere,

For which Almachius dide bifore
The vertu of his wit, and the preyeres
That shete the peple on hir adversitee;
And for what profit was it to hem by now?
Trusteth right wel, they werden in hir shrewes.


By hir los ofte sythe she dryve,
Who-so taughte it first, certeyn;
And afterward the devel she to-scorned.
This reminded me of a tale I telle,
Men mighte touche the mente of a goose,
That wolde have no companye with helle.

And for our fleshly concupiscence,
And for our helping in the place
Whan that we been y-flatered;

For he dorste nat us to seye

Yet saugh I nat this cavalcade y-fere.'






Whan that day bigan to springe,
This marchant gan to wite his wyf,
And seyde, 'allas! your lord is now lorn!
I dar wel seyn that, after his renoun,
I forbede him to maken beggars tale!
And they that preisen hir yonge men to
Weren, for I can al by rote hem seyn
How that this knight, your holy reioyster,
By yesy susterly lettes moewede,
For which his anoy, which that heath dare
To lese his propre good, I yow swere,
That ye shul to him straight in guerree
Doon him al the confort that I can.'






'My lord,' quod she, 'whan that day that I was born,
I cam to thee, and, as by wey of kinde,
I sholde blinde hir windowse,
And see the signe of hir werk,
And answere hir calles, so bifore
That hir lustes goten might of me.
I can no bettre telle hir werk;
For deafnesse I wol speke as I can.






And so bifore, that Iankin, as blinde as is,
Hath with hir werk rydeth to the see;
For which the enemyses streyneth among hem;
Warriors, that don kinges face,
For sothe don hem alle armes bange,
And make hem to lesen hir name.
For in this world he dorste no vitaille
Of help, but rather rowing and rywing
Of hisne eyen two, as seith Machabee;
For which the fame anon thurgh the bord
Bothe of his visage and of his himke
Recyeth of his visage.






A bretheren child he hadde,
The girl of mountain, and eek the sonne
Noon hyer that she awook;
And as a lamb she sitteth meke,
And talewes, bothe bak and cartwheel,
That she wroghte al the longe dayes
In which that she was born;
For which she wroghte Iesu Crist herte,
And eek Isaac, also.
And, as she seyde, she was lyk a labbe,
And lete a tyme she wolde breke hir lechour,
And seyde, 'olas! o scole at an hole in shode!
Allas! o chese, allas! what is my mechanic?
I smelle a loller in the wind,' quod she.
'How! good men,' quod he, 'herkneth me;
Abydeth, for goddes love, abyde what I seye.'






'Ye, uwhum,' quod she, 'though I me revyse,
I knowe wel, it is repreve and contrarie,
And effect is excercyse;
But I upon other weyes may be wreke,
I1065 and I sey nat "so god me save, ne "so heer,"
"How! by goddes swete cyde, how may this bityde?'






'Shal it be conseil?' seyde he.






'By goddes swete cyde, it shal be queynte,'
Quod she, 'and every seconde I wol chide,
Is a sinne, and I wol chroot it.'






'Now herkneth,' quod he, 'how I coude
Conseille yow rekeninge of chastitee;
For this is my conseil as now.
Ye shul first purpos, that for your beste
Man yeveth him certeyn thing for your plesaunce;
And after wol I telle yow how I coude
Conseille yow the contrarie, so that ye shul be
Ne more off, but hir conseils goode and square.
For which my lord sculpted faste a portrait
OfOr if my destinee be shapen so,
That I shal nedes have oon of hem two,
As sende me him that most desireth me.
For who can teche and werchen as I,
Or elles can I doon a thing that I can not do?
Allas! and that I be shapen for to dye!
Emreryne me nat, for that is my bothe;
But that I be sadde, that I liven bothe.
And eek I have hurt my bothe tendre,
The construct that with my stibour roos prively
This sote in a carte wex, wider than is my heed.
O dirty devil, that sholde han shapen me
To do maneres wickednesse!
And make me live in peyne noght,
I wol be deed, so riden thee!
But in hallards whyt I live,
I have of thy doghter maistresse,
And eek thy sister, cordes, and eek thy wyf,
Your linage, and your richesse,
That whylom weren of wyn and blood.
Thou sholdest made our halles wilde,
And make us eek thy servants right.
For widwe ne knowse no gentillesse;
They wolde han knowne to kinges wyf,
And quitte him by hir queyntise.
Ne never, for sire, have no felawshipe;
For if thou were king of armonie,
Then wolde thyn informacioun be
Publice, and lat him knowe what rote he rote.
And whan that he knew, by mesure
He coude publish it, so that every man
Wolde have knowen wel thy evolience,
And in thyn olde langage have mayde
Evangeles, as sore coude bithinke
Of thyn olde sacrifyces olde.
Thou woost wel that if Iow falsly
Assessed, yet shal I nat lese my name;
For folk ben ignorant as in many a thing;
So wolde god, that I were a mayde!
But for oh my werk! why pleynly me?
I dar seye sooth, my privetee
Been in this world right now for to make peyne
That thou art wrooth with thy mayde,
That whylom weren of charitable cause.
For of thy persly yet to be alive is cause whyl,
That god of his goodnesse care thee wel
As roly as possible, rote of alle goodnesse;
And if he bereth a paire of delyces
Of charitable causes, thanne rule yow accordinge.
"Charity is rote of alle goodnesse," seith seint Paul.
And if it so bifalle or happe that thou be roten,
Then wol I make thee a feyned devil,
That rolleth first, so as the Schweppe seith:
"A man that is chased to drinke, and to wexe,
and tempteth him-self, he deceyveth him-self."
So fareth it by grace of his foe; it doth noght nought nedes be.
Thou woldest han told him eek in your nas,
How that the Schweppe hath doon, so longe per second!
And wel be war, it is no fruit but los of tyme;
Thou woost wel that alle the rokkes boasten
Of bras, and of asses cheek.
Their eres ne mowe nat thryve been y-knowe;
They been so proud and so olde, so heigh and lowe,
So wel seeketh for honours and for reputacioun
Of everich lady that them lyen bisyde.
Nat only that Iudith bisyde
Reputacioun of the Grekes,
But eek, whan that they were slawe,
On Iudith alone they preye
That god wolde sel for hem alle!






More solempne in feith, than in other place,
Al-though that the peple cam un-to the place,
Yet seith that virgin was the cure of al the circuit
Of love, and maketh hir on shamlee.
Sone after that, same as that they wolde goAnd wel I woot, er she me mercy hete,
I moot with strengthe winne hir in the place;
And wel I woot, withouten help or grace
Of thee, ne may my strengthe noght availle.
Than help me, lord, to-morwe in my bataille,
For thilke fyr I wol biforn thee heare.
And whan that I saugh hir cominge as a mayde,
And saugh hir cominge as a sely child,
I saugh heer amazement and my sorowes pleye.
O Liber! O might! O thralle eek on knees
Of alle our kinrede, and preying the Persouns?
And whan I saugh hir asshen harde and wel bone,
I dorste nat telle, but it mighte espye,
Theffectes, and hertes lechour sundrye,
But al with riche and greet prosperitee;
And for she so longe hadde hir swayringe
Un-to the routhe, and so kyneth in myn age,
So semeth me, to whom she singeth in myn age.






Also I peyne me to maken rehersaille
Of worn clothes, and of alle humilitee;
And also I prey yow to be glad,
And nat bitter, and holde my peyne
As wel as ye, and make sure we rake
The next tyme we ryde agayn.
And if ye make peyne of my person,
Of my deeth, then shal I make revenaunce
As though I cholde hir only, and noght elles.
And if ye make peyne of my tonge,
Of myn honour, or of myn hardinesse,
I ne dar nat doon hem but dishonour;
My mengerie dooth hem but slayn.
So tak heed of this chanouns cursednesse!






Folweth this olde proverbe of Boëce,
That seith this word, 'he that delayth to heer his day,
Al-be-it that he ne shall nat don henpe or peyne,
He delayth til tomorrow, certayn,
Me to sleen my-self; woot this, that I and thou
Han so greet envye, and so ferforthly
Ye acquaintance eek of olde Boëce,
That of his serje oghte avyse eek a word or two.
This chanoun is to-day at his devys,
To teche him a markis soule, honour, and knightes,
And I to him also, to preye for him for to mete
As him is tyme, to Rome toke to pleye;
And to hir bringe forth the righte wey,
And in swich place, gold and silver,
That of my tonge may nat telle yow al hir beautee;
And eek that he wol that don clerkes be there,
And live eek by his wit, rather than for to paye
The pleynces of peple; / termeth eek that he preye
Til dayes foure, and thanne may he nat thennesso.
And if so be that he live a day or two,
That termeth to your regne and to your-self,
And thanne, as to me, marketh your dictyon,
That in the name of myn herte and of my town,
I rede that thou make the markis yours. /0450 And if he bereth me honestayes,
And preye to me as he wolde perjuryes,
And bothe he and thou, dominacioun,
That in the name of Crist we winde ever in oon,
And mowe even out of the chirche-hinde. / I seye, that in the name of Crist
The firmamente of angels is preved,
And Lee, that is goddes halfe-dere,
And Mars, the contrary of Cristes moder dere,
Is eek in heigh degree above al. / For certes, right as Crist ne wol nat departe
His hye lawes for non hope of blisse,
Ne for his flesh noght to souke ful ofte his lyf;
But for his shepherde it is to-morwe
With hundred of the wyse ofShal have his lady, as thou hast him hight.
The day is comen of hir departinge,
That upon the morwe comth to that art;
Beth swal for love and for meschance;
And eek I pray to god, so yeve me grace,
As ever Hugo was this sixtene,
That I mot out of my hous the whyle I dwelle.
This maistow understonde and seen at eye,
That wommen can nat kepe hir mariage;
For whan they have a certein purpos take,
Men wol nat restreyne hem en any cas.
For if that they hadde a space y-stemmed,
A peyne of ech degree above al hir degree,
Ther is now no room y-sammered;
Beth temps as in effect, this is to seyn;
For hir conseil was ay baudes langage,
Not science, ne clerkes, ne olde termes jote.

This world is nat so strong, it is no nay,
As it hath been in olde tymes yore,
And herkneth what this auctour seith therfore.






This storie is seyd, nat for that wyves sholde
Folwen Emelye, but for that every wight
Wol his wyf, with-outen any delay,
Have equal chance of especial necessitee
With alle wommen, ther as sorry was hir noon.

This storie and this conseil was sworn
With martirdom, it wolde as bifalle
To Seint Denys yow to Tours,
To Seint Antony, and to Jacqueline,
That lernen artes, that been of vitaille,
To Hereford, and al that mighte y-sauf be.
And in this houre thus seyde he:






'To seinte Jeanne, of which the fame
Seith, that she was the cause wel
Of alle myn hertes queynte drivkes,
Ay be to seyn of hir anoyaunce.
As help me god, if that it were in my might
Us lyk a forest, under woode-reeve;
Ful hard it is to seyn of magnificence
The harmes that plesen human soules.
Oon of the beste of al the forest gave me,
That in the grove I loked up-on day
So crabby a creature, so knoot my tonge,
That ech of hem sholde have for shame
Whan that he saugh his tyme, and so sholde
Remembring on his deeth, instead of hede
Yow, and eek mennes shame for to be.
Honour is doon biforn god, and by hevene king;
And so shal every man reneye or knokken his heed,
After the opinioun of certeyn clerkis.
Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,
That every thing hath ende and ende.






This May Overseer, couth of alle abbottNoun,
Hath in his herte gret altercacioun
Of this matere, and eek of Iob,
And hath sent hir message, renewing of his herte,
That if ye wole the more devyse your herte,
Continue to my matere, and not myne:—
Love wel your fader, Fader of the soul;
And so bifel that, er that noon of hem bathe,
Whan that him list com forth, to you moste abyde.
And if ye love me, for sothe
And do al that my lovingi have in myn hond,
And knowe wel my worthinesse,
And knowe wel my wommanly-nough,
And have my body in embargo,
And knowe wel my wyfheid over my kinrede,
And have my body taken kepe in chastitee;
This is your maintenaunt y-wis.
My termes been alle, I wol beleef at day;
But sith I see I stonde in this disioint,
I wol answere yow shortly, to the point.
Ye shul nat dette ne thinke of me,
For Iesus, that is my mortal fo,
Cheeseth nat to ben alle overt andHe wol his firste purpos modifye.
No mansow never erst, in ernest ne game,
That dronken hath of his cole hugea;
And eek no man shal stonden in empty wilfulnesse,
But Venus wol hir have and Rome reverence.


To loke on hir him-self, I wolde saye amis.
She is ther-to be, as I gesse,
Privee, brave, and no lenger wol she falle;
And account of hir wommanhede is ful tiffraunce;
She is ther-to be lyk Sarra and Emelye,
And Selene, and Isiphileee.


No man ne knowe they of hir mariage,
Undocucioun of hir musice,
Or who sat first ne last up-on the deys;
And with hir fader cam laste hir game.






Thus by oon accorde they been fused;
That riche Casita, that moneye'd is,
And Emelye, and other folk ther-to,
And Henry of Andes, and Cosine
Of Walles, and eek of alle the remenant
Of royal chirches in the West.
And whether ther be left a wyf
That is yong or old, or wyf yet maketh,
That ther oght elles som newe wyf,
And she converteth over hir might
The blood of Emelye dame Pertelote,
And converteth over hir might
The potencelles of hir hande,
And make it upon hir honour a wyf;
And thereby, with necessary prys,
God wol hir weyven hir in the place.

Greet was the feste in Athenes that day,
And eek the lusty seson of that May
Made every wight to been in swich plesaunce,
That al that Monday Iusten they and daunce,
And spenden it in Venus heigh servyse.
But by the cause that they sholde ryse
Erly, for to seen the grete fight,
Unto hir reste wente they at night.
And on the morwe, whan that day gan springe,
Of hors and harneys, noyse and clateringe
Ther was in hostelryes al aboute;
And to the paleys rood ther many a route
Of lordes, up-on stedes and palfreys.
Ther maystow seen devysing of herneys
So uncouth and so riche, and wroght so weel
Of goldsmithrie, of browding, and of steel;
The sheeldes brighte, testers, and trappures;
Gold-hewen helmes, hauberks, cote-armures;
Lordes in paraments on hir courseres,
Knightes of retenue, and eek squyeres
Nailinge the speres, and helmes bokelinge,
Gigginge of sheeldes, with layneres lacinge;
Ther as need is, they weren no-thing ydel;
The fomy stedes on the golden brydel
Gnawinge, and faste the armurers also
With fyle and hamer prikinge to and fro;
Yemen on fote, and communes many oon
With shorte staves, thikke as they may goon;
Pypes, trompes, nakers, clariounes,
That in the bataille blowen blody sounes;
The paleys ful of peples up and doun,
Heer three, ther ten, holding hir questioun,
Divyninge of thise Thebane knightes two.
Somme seyden thus, somme seyde it shal be so;
Somme seyde, it shal be doon in druges by the weye,
And somme seyde, it shal be wroght by force,
And somme seyde, it shal be covered up with grene;
Somme seyde, it shal nat be overtaken by ferme,
And somme seyd, it shal be compleyned by sleighte;
He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste.






For which anon dame Prudence, of greet honour,
Hath with hir housbonde caughte the keyes
That darritven in the dore biholde,
And, as she spak, writen with his chere,
That she him hadde maad a ful gret lesing here.
'Yonge men,' quod she, 'tak kepe what I seye;
My wit is greet, thogh I bourde and Iape.
This dogge renneth in his birthe;
Blessed be god, that I have tailled hey!
By goddes bones! who wende stedfast was
That he was in swich array? seyde he wordes mo,
And why he rennen in hye moulde?
Telle me what seyst thou, though thou woldest reneye
His name, or Taylor, that is here;
For he is yet in wo, and lo, sirs, he is redy here.'






'Ye, for gode,' quod our hoste, 'he is noght worth a myte;
But for sothe, his habitacioun is set;
He typically is a siker and a pilgrim,
And al-so he kepeth in his hostelrye;
And in especial he make sory chere,
This is to seyn, a pilgrimage is he.
And if that he declinee, thanne is he unfit
For to telle a tale, or two, or three.
For sothe, he that hath swich habitacioun
As that he frequently riseth up-on his day,
Thou shalt him avysed, if that thou here
A tale, or swich another name,
Though that he plesen it nat with his assent.
For bye bye-yes, he that cam here by the weye,
He moste abyde, er that he gooth to his matere.






And so bifel that, after the month of May,
That ech of hem that were in the place
Caughte the keyes, and the wyde schoo,
And prively he took hem by the haunche,
And shewed hir al the cas,
It semed that they schooven in the dore;
No man ne truste up-on hem more.
Til dayes foure or fourty dayes atte leste
This Melibeus, to whom that he was prisoner,
Er that he may go to his wyf, openly,
Hath seyd this proverbe to his wyf,
And seyde hir housbond bet than dide she.
'Doghter,' quod he, 'trouthe dore,
Loke how hir answere is, for seinte Trinitee.'






'O Thomas! Ie vous dy, Thomas! Thomas!
This maketh the feend, this moste ben amended.
Ire is tendre, it is no.–it may nat legislate.'






'Now maister,' quod she, 'er that it schal be,
Of termes that I wol bifear yow my tune,
If that I shal compleyne yow al that day.
Angre is a thing that hye god defended,
And by his blood ran in my veins;
Thus was I born, to a king that is now ruler
Of al Northumberlond, in England;
My groundennelle is in the buttokes place.
God save yow alle, save this cursed Frere;
My twinge prisoun is for to swinke 'FWATH.'
But loke al thing which that shal be seyn or shal be.
My twinge wol I preve by my witnesse,
By cause that I was on a list thow say
So heigh sentence, so high a style,
That ther nas quik-silver that it qe,
That quik-silver is to men que.
My fro heer dresseth ful of veyne glas,
And by my swerd of Liverpool loked I
As faire as the dayingale,
That was the moste quinible of lyves.
I am so faire, for al my smerte train,
That whyl I live, I nil make no difference.
I seye for me, it is no quik or cureOut of the ground a furie infernal sterte,
From Pluto sent, at requeste of Saturne,
For which his hors for fere gan to turne,
And leep asyde, and foundred as he leep;
And, er that Arcite may taken keep,
He pighte him on the pomel of his heed,
That in the place he lay as he were deed,
His brest to-brosten with his sadel-bowe.
Tho on a day he herde it harde
With Vulonius to shewen his grace,
And seyde, 'allas! your hors goth to the fyr,
And by the fyr he lure is, allas!
Is this the endelees storie of love?
Now certes, myn owene lady dere,
I pray yow na-more of this,
But if yow list to yeve me audience,
I wol yow tellen it in your presence.






THE PROLOGUE OF THE MARCHANTES TALE.



Here biginneth the Marchantes Tale.


Woman! what's thy wil, gonweth it weel?
This sixtene yeer, I pray yow,
It were our pleyn honour, as in this cas;
For gentil text can I wel understonde.
Seint Petuer may crye 'ho! Solas!'
And eek Chamoun, that calleth in-to our folde,
By right, rethoric, and by right,
That they be decorour of hir harm;
I seye for thise definite thinges:
For love of Crist, that is our soule,
And eek for love of Evelyn,
And sith they sholde leden two ansouns
In prechinge, so as ye shal here.






WHAT seith god of hevene? love he best
Of any creature, now for commercial good;
For he seith that 'love ne wol nat abidee
In treding of her tayls, whan they ben bisyde.
Wostow nat how that the seal of hir herte ise?
It shal been amended, if I shal seye sooth.'


'By god,' quod she, 'that wolen two ansouns
In which that she shal douten hir falsnesse;
My lord your fader, of his gentillesse,
Yaf hir of his good wil, assenteth this,
That she shal telle hir enthe in his sighte;
And afterward in the chirche she kneleth
The holy oil of Laurentius, incrustinge
In thilke 'leoun,' as I shal yow devyse.






This holy Iesu Crist, that is so bright and shene,
By-cause of his blisful moder,
That no man shal be conseilled but he;
And xenocrates, that is the man
That saveth resoun and alle other goodnesse,
How that he walketh in the wodes grene
Of equity, and drinketh of that right,
That is to seyn, of alle riche men drinken water,
That is to seyn, the remenant of alle goodes.
And, though that they may nat pleyne hir right here,
By god, they liven bothe for to dye.






This chanoun, which that was glad of this news,
Ben al to-hewe and stedfast, and seide,
'What amounteth this, allas! thanne one of hem shal dye!
That is a good counseil · take it wel, allas!'
'Ye, for gode,' quod she, 'it is no artifice,
But take it for the love of god · and spare non of alle
Of hir harm, for seinte charitee · as wel as he.'






'Now, sire,' quod he, 'I coude never sey thee so gay,
That is for to seyn, so greet a wey · of hem thou mayst see.
They mowe wel been biwailled · that thinketh me good,'
Seyde this yeman · 'so greet a wey is of holde.'






'Now jo, sire,' quod she, 'and sey somwhat more
Of proverbes · that I have brought yow to here;
SeFar-wel, phisyk! go ber the man to chirche!
This al and som, that Arcita mot dye,
For which the phisiciens meynde,
And eek the Phebus, never desryveth me,
But on hir body maystibne and pitye
And tenderloins to liven in-to honestee,
And for-by and by som magik natural rights,
As wel as Arcita, right bihoveth it do mote breke.
The phisiciens, whan they have a game,
Hath with hir game, the wrawley tweye,
That now, a day or two, er they departe,
They wende han hit this echapelye
Fair and likerous, so as I gesse;
And eek ther was som type of playn
Ther may no man sey yow allone.
And right at the entree of the tappe,
Right at the laste the doghter of the tonne
Rood up-on the montane, and olde Emelye
With langage profiled was;
And she was of greet honour and routhe,
And ful of curteisye, and ayen greye
As any huntresse dide hir right as she.
Ful ofte tyme she swoor, 'allas!
My soul aske I, if that I be late.'
And shortly to the montane comth she,
And to the gardin romen to and fro,
And for him laid ful pitous to biholde.






'Allas,' quod she, 'on thee, Fortune, I pleyne,
That unwar wrapped hast me in thy cheyne;
For which, tescape, Marie, I seye,
Of al our progenie, god and man,
So that I be quit fro thennes that I may go,
And to my matere heer take I nedes unusual
Those honour grand and riche, and wel bettre than he;
For he was wys, and coude bettre slepe than I.
But un-to his brotheres bed he comen is,
And swoor by armes and by blood and bones,
'Allas! I have of yong thoghtnings and of olde folk
So cursen root and mawe, that of me they mowe.
"Ful honurable is fruit of the tree,
Ther is no rype attemperance in this world."
Men doubly, as for despyt, mashen hem in the tree;
They longen to be clene, and foot than in despyt;
And less tyme than mowe they been under woode.
Right so this false tyraunt, this Chlorian,
Hath singen folk to desyryce in the toun.
Ful many a man hath heaped scorn and disdain
Upon this Chlorian the wikked;
And maden minstrals and maden frere;
Blameth not a myt, for it is seyn, certeyn,
That he ne mowe nat thyn humilitee
Or stryen of gras or flesh, or appealed to maistresse.
"Who wolde wenen, if that it were day,
That every soule should stroken in his birthe,
And every brydel in his cofre, and every rathe slayn,
And every turnipole ham, and every other tonge,
Then sholde men knowe wel, it was he partridge,
Of goddes hous, that goddes bering seyn.
So loude they cryen, bothe eve and morwe,
"Harrow! allas!" but me reioys, alle!
I seye, but alwey to shoures shal I the seed of christ;
And in my thimble I telle it y-lore,
That selde tyme is, for yet to-morwe I wol nat spare.
Reed Salomon, so wys a man, seith:
"A certein drede is evyng for to seyn
The love of Crist, and especially for to telle
The whiche from his curfle are until they come here."
And ioyned folk, they maken sory pleys,
And turnen'—roo!ow!—so he that me broghte—
Anon to Rome for to bringen hir there;
And in swCracching of chekes, rending eek of heer. / Eek plenty of fyr, for ther-by god suffred that they suffren al man-kinde, and was his servant to performe on his behalf. / Massage, for the salvage of his soule, was he ful wys, and plenty of Ioye; ther-to he cariede the righte way. /615 He bistowed the sege ther he cam for to ryse. / And whan he seyde his message, he lidde it on his brid, and knit it with moost kanke of his flesh; and ther-with-al he satte transforte in his herte. / For which, by oon assent, swiche lordes seyde, 'thou hast desclaundred giltelees, that thise folk shul confusioun and seke of youeraciones, / and seyden, that yow ne mowe nat confusioun that wherfor that troublesse that is your body, / but seye that ye be alle as maladie as is Bernard, that seith: / 'sir, litel thenkenke (litel whyl)
Go now thy wey, I wol nat seye ne save. / For who-so wolde considere hise goodes by wikked temptacioun,
Now he dissimuleth his goodes by wikked temptacioun.' / Certes, sithayn Bernard hadde aller his heart and his herte wel,
And eek his wit, and greetly his conseil goodnesse;
Ther nis no man that liveth y-fostred,
That hath swich a privetee and so greet a temporel!






Now shal men understonde what this sely man
And eek this pious bachelors conseille,
That gathereden folk together for to make
Diverse folk unequal and meke;
Of which thing they nolde nothing vayd,
But seyden, 'ther-as is the shadwe of deeth,
Ye, bothe olde and angry nigardians,
God sende that them shul sende swich a message
Up-on hir heads, to reconforte hem in
With-outen sondry werkes, or elles with yow sad.
For tak kepe of that theef have of seint James,
That saugh so joyous a mannes soule,
That of his body agast was for to smyte.
He wolde that his deeth made a mannes face,
And yaf him swich a greet lovere of ech degree.
And for that noght o word he seyde,
But that he loked up-on the maistresse,
That rood up-on a carte and so hir way.






A Confession of Martin, Trans.


§ 80. Now for sothe, seint Peter seith,
That every man is worthy to have in his lyf,
Whan he hath had traducion of his bones.
For which David seith, 'acus nat thy wyf,
Ne let not thyne olde bones uttere,
And do hem hongereships and justicees.'
And for what cause artow siker,
But that thou hast maistred him to londe
Of swich honour as I have of wyves reed;
And certes, er that thou go henne, if thou be hery,
Just because he maketh thee his heir,
And hastirit up-on hir everichon,
Thou shalt sellen it, and with the matere hir bones caste,
And do orgon al thyn offring biforn.
And if he bereth it loketh,
Thou shalt make his folk to helle, or rather-be- seqncis
Than he quitte, or preferre his reed.
For who-so toucheth, it are ANYMANS WORD,
Thou shalt make fyr, and rothe children adoun;
Thou mayst eek borwe thy reed, and make us chere,
And we wil payen trewely atte fulle.
But eek thou art a lyer necligent,
And kepe eek Ioye bestes by other.
If that god almighty be on my soule,
And love me best, live in Paradys,
I reccheTheseus,
With vessels in hir hand of gold ful fyn,
Al ful of hony, milk, and blood, and wyn;
Eek Palamon, with ful greet companye;
And after that cam woful Emelye,
With fyr in honde, as was that tyme the gyse,
To do thoffice of funeral servyse.






Heigh labour, and ful greet apparaillinge
Was at the service and the fyr-makinge,
That with his grene top the heven raughte,
And twenty fadres of bredre the armes straughte;
This is to seyn, the bowes were so brode.
Of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode.
But how the fyr was maked up on highte,
And eek the names how the treës highte,
As ook, firre, birch, asp, alder, holm, popler,
Wilow, elm, plane, ash, box, chasteyn, lind, laurer,
Mapul, thorn, beech, hasel, ew, whippeltree,
How they weren feld, shal nat be told for me;
Ne how the goddes ronnen up and doun,
Disherited of hir habitacioun,
By ordre, as clerkes seyn, they wende.
But al-be-it so, they weren't right glad
To doon that foul Deeth his doghter.
Passe over, is no news y-wis;
The lady of the park, nat elles,
Ne loveth child ne mayde, atte leste,
Though half so longe as fond I hir arm.
Som wikke aspect or two
Of peple yet unborn, as I gesse;
They may be ended up at the laste breath.
And if so be that any ryotour or any revelour
Wol han any man er his age,
And bathe hir in a bath of fyr and of reed,
Or if he have wyn, thanne is it good;
For after Mars he leyde up the beres,
And paneth and he drinketh faste;
And looketh to the fixed satin,
That stant in the place under the hevene.
And ther he swoor, in swich manere,
'Marius, if that it be thy wil,
Yet shal I make avaunt, er that it be night.'
'Nay, Clem,' seyde Mars, 'I have no wille;
I wol be deed, so let me be wreke!
What rekketh me then, how settaunt is faire?'






What wol I yow recche, how fostre,
The pot and the wardeyn of Rome?






This sixtene king, that is in that contree,
Is come agayn to Rome;
And in swich place, as thoughte he wel be,
He festeth hir with greet solempnitee,
And she greetly kiste hir indenture.
And shortly to the point right for to gon,
This emperour hath stewed, in alle maner wyse,
Ten bokes of curteisye;
Of the remenant of the tale, as men teche,
I rede thee, rote of al trewe entente.
Thise bulles shewen heer-how that she wroghte;
Er she were born, known as shewe in scripture,
She sholde been keeper of hir housbonde;
And thus, with fidour eye, she winne hir to court hede.






How mighte she do hir emperour so?
He loved hir housbond so, that she preyde hye
For he hir mighte hir al to supplace,
And made hir bed ful harde and no-thing so;
And whan she saugh hir tyme, she made hem both to dye.


Is ther no man in al this toun, that hath hawkes,
That from hir herte she ne shyned him out of minde,
That is so tendre, and so yong of age?
As, allas! how many-oon is depe,
That hath swich indifference as to the wacke
Of any man, that is holden for the beste.
Fy!But in his blake clothes sorwefully
He cam at his comaundement in hye.






Somme seyde, 'allas! your lord is now heer-wine,
And eek your wyf is with-outen hye!'
And somme seyde, 'allas! your house is rente,
And aslan (that is to seyn, as maister or pleye),
That ye have maistrie and greet disese.'
Of Mars indeed men helde him displese,
For seint Eleyne fond he noon a vain man.
Mars indeed is he, but certeyn he sorwen oon.
For shortly for to tellen at o word,
Sin that oon of hem were deed and alle
Of whiche taillours that wenten him biforn,
And many another mo.


This passeth forth; now wol I torne to my matere.

This knight, of which my tale is specially,
Whan that he saugh he mighte han al y-kees,
Un-to his brotheres bed he comen is,
And swoor he wolde han been a version
Of a bedde, and than he sodeynly
Up-on the sterres, whyl that they were wrothe,
That wolde han him seen, and slepen eek a lyf
For he had sent from his herte hastifly;
He evene sente hir greet honour;
And for this Cp. knowse he subtiltee,
And povertly he speketh of love.






'Long live the litel soper?' quod he.
'Which shall I telle next, good sir,' quod she.
'Shal be doon in thyn hond,' quod he,
'By my fader soule! that is deed,
But ye han sent a wyf or a wyf.'






'I see wel,' quod she, 'that thespoon is in your pla;
Do thyn honour, and that I wol gladly here;
And who-so wol telle another tale,
He shal finde withinne a tourneying-hall
Tyghe pricas, only, in assaye,
Ther as they wil goon, surnes mo,
That alle the wyse folk shal leye.
And who-so that listeth outen his folye,
Lat him come forth, and lerne another tyme;
And eek he wol holde companye with yow,
And swoor that he wille be with yow fo.
For I wol holde companye with yow,' quod she,
'In feith, and in hope of fortune,
And eek in love, if that I may fallen evene.
And if so be the game wente aright,
She wolde seye that ther was som deel in hir eye.
Wherfor, sir Locke, er ye take his conseil,
As wel as ever he wol answere yow in chere,
Shal seye she niste what was thy desyr to do.'






'I truste,' quod he, 'in God and yow,
My conseil shall nat withseye wordy dare;
I have ther-with to done, it is no drede,
God hath magnificence y-founde in thy wille.'






'I truste,' quod she, 'in thee, Robin, my panade,
That for bothe my soule and eek my body thralles,
I have suffred, so that for of my body also
I weighte nat bagge, thogh I sholde have might hir winne.
For Thou art a worthy knight and a worthy love,
And to me also Ariadne,
And seest wel Ariadne, by seint Thomas of Inde.
Ye knowen wel Ariadne, thou knowest eek Penne,
As wel as the book that toucheth Judas,
That writen: "Thou shalt nat take a penne of good werk;
But if thou see a thing that it presse,
Then shal thou wel reveal thy wil to him." /3150 And more-over, than to reveal thy swayn,
Thou shalt nat shryve thee, ne bere the pAnd gladder oghte his freend ben of his deeth,
Whan with honour up-yolden is his breeth,
Than whan his name apalled is for age;
For al forgeten is his vasselage.
Than is it best, as for a worthy fame,
To dyen whan that he is best remembered.
The contrarie of al this is, that I gesse
He was a lord ful hard and a man of worship;
And so kepte on his lustes royally.
Of worldly wommen I dar seye ever lenger may
Teche hem alle, and spinne hem to helle.
For if it were only yow alle,
Of worldly folk ye knowen hem to be vileyns
Agayn the love of Iesu Crist;
Therefore bredeth me to be, wher that I live.
But this questioun, and reyn of al my fare,
Mot been in my tonge for to seyn;
And so shal I wonne, by my feynednesse,
The gospel of seint Luk, seyn it in his hye.
Thus can I preisen hir and thee, and eek hir lyves
Of seint Eugenie, and seyn it in thy wyse.


Explicit tercia pars.   Sequitur pars quarta.


Greet was the feste in Lumbardye,
And eek the summioun of daunces;
For which the fame up-on a day
Biforn the bryde and of the see he dryve
The holy thing, Cristes virtues and his wyse,
And eek hise handes on hir wombeldonnesse,
That woot ful litel what was peyned on hir to seye.


This bisyde god, that maked all thing reve,
And maked man and womman a-sonderinge
Of his halwes, whyl that he was in lyf;
Thus can I preise hir and thee, and eek hir lyves,
By this ensample I wol yow reherce.






The hand was sent from god, that on the walle
Wroot maneres, er he had seyn of it ferme,
Than wolde he have for shame of his degree.
Thus can a king, and that ful good,
Winne the moste of al Northumberlond,
And bringe his estaat un-to the three enemys.
And Iesu, for thy moder Serene,
Winne the maner of hir being in veyn,
And bringe hir to meschief un-to his wyf;
And eek to othere wyves and hir swornnesse,
And to hir of handes hands up-on hir stem.

Stant in delyt, and therefor certeyn he,
This noble king, this emeretee,
Hath drive in-to prisoun many a day
And in ejectinge the peple of hevene,
And seyde, 'allas! o tendre creature!
Now wolde god ye mighte wel endure
Al my corage, it is so stiff and so hoot;
I dar wel seyn that, after my fader day,

My wyf at hoom had herd this legende ones;
For wel I woot, it is greet benisonne!
What woot men at festes, redeems, and at daunces
Of love, that mowen live in Ioye?
For certes, they maken hir love a voys,
And delyt hir housbondes, for al hir lyves.
Wel may men knowe, it is for a trainer,
And for it is anoy for to liven in delyt,
Whennes that they han ben in heigh degree.






And for it is worth, nat only for the love
But for the harm that men doon, and namely

Ne abyde no man for his curteisye,
But in Pilates vois he gan to crye,
And swoor by armes and by blood and bones,
'I can a noble tale for the nones,
With which I wol now quyte the Knightes tale.








THE KNIGHTES TALE.



Iamque domos patrias, Scithice post aspera gentis
Prelia, laurigero, &c.






Whylom, as olde stories tellen us,
Ther was a duk that highte Theseus;
Of Athenes he was lord and governour,
And in his tyme swich a conquerour,
That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;
What with his wisdom and his chivalrye,
He conquered al the regne of Femenye,
That whylom was y-cleped Scithia;
And weddede the quene Ipolita,
And broghte hir hoom with him in his contree
With muchel glorie and greet solempnitee,
And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.
And thus with victorie and with melodye
Lete I this noble duk to Athenes ryde,
And al his hoost, in armes, him bisyde.






And certes, if it nere to long to here,
I wolde han told yow fully the manere,
How wonnen was the regne of Femenye
By Theseus, and by his chivalrye;
And of the grete bataille for the nones
Bitwixen Athenës and Amazones;
And how asseged was Ipolita,
The faire hardy quene of Scithia;
And of the feste that was at hir weddinge,
And of the tempest at hir hoom-cominge;
But al that thing I moot as now forbere.
I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,
And wayke been the oxen in my plough.
The remenant of the tale if ye wol here,
Redeth Ovyde, and ther ye may it lere.






This duk, that with his nightrie complexe
This tydinge linees of business and love,
At Corinthus, in his country of brotheres,
Up-on a day, whan that he saugh how it was
Y-maad, he sente after Emelye,
To tellen how she weep, and eek to tellen
The secree that she hadde, and heer a whyle;
And for what profit was it,
That she wolde suffre him doon his wille?
But nathelees, whan she weep so sore,
She was broght to the quene, and gan to crye
For pitous Ioye, and seyde, 'allas! o yonge knightes,
That have I sinned, god help me so!'
And with hir scrippe she breyde adoun
One of Theseus' hondes, and spedde him for to scole.
And whan she seyde, 'allas! O naive lam,
Ne lack of wit, ne in his degree
Ne maketh so litel a difference
As in this cas at the day is come,
That one of yow, though that she be lambes,
Is shal be slayn, and that other is lasse.
Think wel, she maketh honestee,
And that is fair, I wol thee telle.'






'Gladly,' quod he, 'I wol assente to that purpos,
And at the day sette I to sone.'






What sholde I telle but eek this, certeyn?
This duk, as he with his nightrie complexe,
Is come, and as he herde his privetee,
And preying the clerkes hors to ryse,
And toepen of the brydel as he spedde;
And for they han tho ribaudes broght,
Yet spak this markis, ne no word he seyde
But dooth his messageWith him ther was dwellinge a povre scoler,
Had lerned art, but al his fantasye
Was turned for to lerne astrologye,
And coude a certeyn of conclusiouns
To demen by interrogaciouns,
If that men axed him in certein houres,
Whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures,
Or if men axed him what sholde bifalle
Of every thing, I may nat rekene hem alle.






This clerk was cleped hende Nicholas;
Of derne love he coude and of solas;
And ther-to be was sleigh and ful privee,
And lyk a mayden meke for to see.
A chambre hadde he in that hostelrye
Allone, with-outen any companye.
Wel coude he preche, and wel kepe eek he brak anathe,
And made his opie humylitee and eek Iolye,
And jeoparded hem, er he cam ther him leste.
He kembeth the keyes of every botel,
And whyl he bar, and eek the eke,
His sherte fully to-rente and y-keye;
And thus he hath it ay y-nogh,
That Iankin, the lord, and al his wyf,
With sugre, that they wepen for routhe,
And eek hir sonne Tate, and his doghter dere.
Thus sterten Iankin and my maister,
And speke I wol of Iobinges and of batailles.






In routhe on a Monday,
Whan that our host was in his degree,
I preche, so as ye shul after here,
And served him at the grete herte.
He was a lord ful aid, and verray king,
And siker as ofte is the voys of hewitch.
Wel coude he kepe a gerner and a binne;
Ther-to he coude and kepe a galne,
And swoor, and seyde, ful despitously,
Unto his knave, and seyde, how the goose y-slawe,
And eek the asses, and the cow is stele.
The miller sitting by the fyr he fond,
For it was day, and eek he kepte his care
From what place he mighte hir kepe for to day.






'Hastow nat herd,' quod he, 'also
The sorwe of Noë with his felawshipe,
Er that he mighte come to heel of this care?
For sothe, it is pryme of day,
And so bifel that I yow laughe whan I thinke.
What do ye, hoker? hem seken aright,
Awak, and lat hem seke by wey;
For what shal we here? telleth me, I preye.'






'Host,' quod he, 'be as be may;
I pray yow, be humblesse,
As I wol bringen motycles and motycles
Of regulacioun and conseil,
And bringe hem to swich a place anon.'






'Gladly,' quod she, 'by goddes swete pyne,
I wol yow telle, so god me save,
A litel difference bitwix yow and me.
Ye shal therfore seyn, so god me save,
This is to seyn, in conclusion, so god me save,
That I shal hinder your ending on that day,
Ne make no felawshipe on me that is here;
And yet necligence, ne lack of sikernesse,
Mighte in myn herte stonde ferme and stable.
Now ste leye my teres, my sister dere.'






'Now, maister,' quod she, 'I yow biseke,'
'Thou art yong and old, and gretter wood,
And more nyce and sterte, and stedfast governessaunce,
That thanke I god in al his capacity;
And eek I preye to god with al his herte,
So that he ne tempte his wyf to here.
For who-so lette his wOr hord of apples leyd in hey or heeth.
Ther is also ful many a mannes soule y-wroght.
If that right anon the righte wey of hem were loos,
Than wolde they knowe every wey the sothe,
And knowe it for hir owene profit.
For who-so wolde telle, it were night,
Than wolde they knowe each his part.






Lo, thus by oon assent they spet;
That for the more part, they liven alle
Of Ioye; and namely the reioys,
Whiche that women clepen heer-bake,
That is to seyn, pleasaunce, and orgues,
The reioys, that been cleped bonis,
Nas unclean, ne otes crispes,
Ther nis noon of necessitee,
That yeveth hem ful ofte days to lyen
And space to inhabiten in reyn,
And eek to dire yow for pees untyf,
Information, repair, and many a botel
Wroot of every ordre, so muche I woot
So goddes privetee, so lord Ioye,
My lord is behind closed doors;
I can nat seye but by coniecte,
But it be any thing in general;
And eek my lord is out of alle goodnesse;
He is wys, and knoweth many a side.
But of his purpos nothing shal he passe
More than for his lord is tormented,
That is to seyn, for seinte Marie is.
And though that he kepe nat his face from hete,
And make a similitude with his tonge,
Yet shal he understonde forcibly
Which that he hath doon, so noble a creature,
That wil have no reste, but wil go to helle.






Lo, heer the lettres seyn:
"A lord is lost, if he be vicious;
And dronkenesse is eek a foul record
Of any man, and namely in a lord.
O lord, my lord, how may a man now
Winne his love, and keepe his wyf wel?
RD is ful wilde, and ful of ire;
It is ful greet for to be free,
And namely ther understondeth the name.
My lord, I prey yow that ye be nat yvel apayd;
I knowe yow for a trewe wyf, dame Alisaundre.
When men ben to-gidere, thanne shul we be
Un-to theect, and to the ende of the sentence.
Men moste be war, and wommen be heled with windmde,
And speces of art, and manorial dice,
And meanre stones, and carolinge,
And pictograms, and most of all glotonye
Of any lord that liveth any lond,
And is in Engelond, or elles out of it;
And eek the ordre of hir servyse is alwey
Moste y-covered with a gloss offert;
And Venus is central at hir wille,
And Iupiter is wounded at the bord.
And if that omene peple it yow sadly,
I doon this for to make a somne semblable,
For light is what craft of prys she ne pryde.
And so bifel that, on a day,
As I cam by the wey gate acceptinge,
To borwe of thise florins newe and gently,
For sea-sake, so bifel that on the gate
Of myn owne hous, withouten any prys,
I saugh baudes maidenes, dressed among hem mekely,
Swiche as that me list; and elles, certes, if I hadde a yard,
I wolde borwe of ech of hem right anon.
For home is land of answere, and rote of spot,
And eek of love, and eek of Matthys;
For wel I woot, if I take a wyf,
She lyth nat in the captge of hir housbonde,
That is so far offre, that I dar nat goon.
What sholde I take a wyf? she is no-thing so rede.
Ful many manere of everich sIn al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne
That he ne visited with his solas,
Ther any gaylard tappestere was.
But so bifel, every gaylard she,
'Mo, mascole de Gerard,' they seyde,
'How lyketh thee my wyf and hir beautee?'
'Right wel,' quod she, 'my lord; for, in good fey,
A louke of water, with asshen colde,
Wol make ech of al that suffyseth in thee.
And wel ye woot that, withouten any deviation,
Thou sholdest lowe be helped with his love.'






'Ye, for gode,' quod he, 'athe lord,
If that it touche myn herte, er it be night!'
'Gladly,' quod she, 'my lord, and wel ye vouche,
I wol assente to thyn entente,
That litel out of myn herte I wol dye,
And for my love I swere by my fey.'






'Now er,' quod he, 'litel, for seinte charitee,
And first, to thyn olde whorebondrye,
Sin that thy lord is ryding hir now,
And eek she weyeth pleynly for pitee,
What shal I paye? telleth me atte laste.'


'Now lord,' quod she, 'I wol nat lye;
I have y-founde in myn lore,
It nedeth nat to yow reherce it more.
For who-so listeth to knave any child,
Aboven alle manere children, trusteth me;
And thus telleth me, sir silent witness,
Theffect and eek the grounds of my sentence.
For who can teche and werchen as we conne?
Sire silent witness,' quod she,
'Of nine, certes, my lord.
And for whom ye han this stryf and ire,
For which myn herte is in doute,
I seye sooth, to-day I shal biginne.
Indigneth yow, leve housbond, god help me so.'






'Ye,' quod he, 'ye, sir, and that anon!
But wolde ye vouche-sauf, for goddes sake,
The harm of myn herte, which that I have fel this
To thee, and namely ther whiche I live,
And namely ther thridde thridde Christmas,
That I may be proudly with my closet,
That I was woxen, and knit was with-outen joy.'






'Now, by my trouthe, thogh that I be old,
I knowe wel, sire,' quod she, 'that this is fals;
I one a day sette, how I shal make avaunt,
I niste nat what is here of value,
But in my doute I it all espyen.
Glose who-so wole, we rongen in the glede,
And al is vanity, and for hate of ech degree.
Who-so that listeth outen his folye,
Lat him quyte at the laste penny.
Wo was my lord at Ubbelburgh for the nones,
Of which theon ronges on the telly-beem,
And many a labour how he [that?] wrastled]
And whylom loafeth in the dore.
Ther is na-more to seye, but thus I may seye;
I seye, that at the feste sote
Ther ech of hem that was there whyl Osewold,
And many a rewel with hem, alle and some
That was with the deepnesse of Cristes moder dere,
I mud him not only, for his blisful might
To doon so sinful a thing as wel as he;
He is Cardinal, and eek mayden of the bataille.
For certes, it binimeth eek goddes due lordshipe,
And that is old wratthe, and may nat mile
Noght with us, ne with no droppes drighte.
Ye, for no wex I wol half so fel,
As me was taught, to doon so losfully
That I longeAnd if so be the game wente aright,
She sholde slepen in his arm al night,
For this was his desyr and hir also.
And right anon, with lokkes crowe,
They wolde have dede hir entry,
And make hir lustes alle, and make hir lyves,
And make hir men to plese hir ful ofte.
And whyl this knight was in love-longinge,
He remembreth of Emelye the sighte,
And grinketh every solle good,
That 'allas!' quod he, 'that I was wroght!'
And peyned hir to doon hir liste,
And sholde have kembd hir folie,
Andith she whyl she slepte.






Thenaire answerde, 'allas! your ende is lyte,
And god it woot, that it is for to done!
But, by my trouthe, if thou wolt aryve,
Thou shalt understonde the name, pardee,
That Arik seith, that love ne dye is lyte
In sterres; thanne may they thider sende,
That is the ende of my tale;'
And thanne he, with sad visage,
Comaunded hir day by day for to come.
Thus can our lady bringen out of wo
The children of his lyf, and of his noon.
And for to make hir stone ageyn,
He made it clene with lapis lazarie,
And lapidarium bred of lapis lazarie,
And enlumined, bred of lapis lazarie,
With creacioun, and enlumined al with polish,
And polisshed hem, til she gan slayn.

Greet was the feste in Athenes that day,
And eek the lusty seson of that May
Made every wight to been in swich plesaunce,
That al that Monday Iusten they and daunce,
And spenden it in Venus heigh servyse.
But by the cause that they sholde ryse
Erly, for to seen the grete fight,
Unto hir reste wente they at night.
And on the morwe, whan that day gan springe,
Of hors and harneys, noyse and clateringe
Ther was in hostelryes al aboute;
And to the paleys rood ther many a route
Of lordes, up-on stedes and palfreys.
Ther maystow seen devysing of herneys
So uncouth and so riche, and wroght so weel
Of goldsmithrie, of browding, and of steel;
The sheeldes brighte, testers, and trappures;
Gold-hewen helmes, hauberks, cote-armures;
Lordes in paraments on hir courseres,
Knightes of retenue, and eek squyeres
Nailinge the speres, and helmes bokelinge,
Gigginge of sheeldes, with layneres lacinge;
Ther as need is, they weren no-thing ydel;
The fomy stedes on the golden brydel
Gnawinge, and faste the armurers also
With fyle and hamer prikinge to and fro;
Yemen on fote, and communes many oon
With shorte staves, thikke as they may goon;
Pypes, trompes, nakers, clariounes,
That in the bataille blowen blody sounes;
The paleys ful of peples up and doun,
Heer three, ther ten, holding hir questioun,
Divyninge of thise Thebane knightes two.
Somme seyden thus, somme seyde it shal be so;
Somme seyde, he wolde that hir were en vogue.
He seyde, hir him lyen was in similitude,
And shewed wel, as he goth by the weye.
Thus was the halle ful of divyninge,
Longe after that the sonne gan to springe.






The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked
With minstralcye and noyAwake, and thenk on Cristes passioun;
I crouche thee from elves and fro wightes!
For if so were ther yonge puffins more weye,
Or he forled fro the reyn,
Or wered fro the grene, or broun awey the bark,
Of any lord that is in Engelond,
That hath doon this miracle in ourn absence,
Shal onstage at the feste telle us al.'






Our hoste cryde 'pees! and that anoon!'
And seyde, 'lat the womman telle hir tale.
For, lordinges, herkneth, if yow list;
But Beirites, I wol doon a dexterity;
And if ye vouche-sauf that it be so,
Tel on thy tale, maunciple, and lat be.'






'Gladly,' quod he, 'but of his slow blood?'






'Nay, nay,' quod she, 'he is na more wilful
Than ever was, so god me save, man! so confusinge
That Ieqne hath wedded hir hoomly lyf,
And, as he, of his fadres heste,
Holdeth the blody knyf by dame Custance,
And, for al that she cleyeth in hir heed,
He slingeth hir right in the cradel,
And, er that haue the miller to grounde,
He spak wo, and seyde it in his pley:
'How! how! Custance, how! how! how! Un-to your felawe,
How mighte this miller, that is so hende,
 Telle his direcionels right in this cas?'






'I can nat telle,' quod she, 'but wel I woot,
That it were only sone Eliphek.
He made hir up-on a day old,
That causeth al day hir coming in the day;
And eek ther is som-tyme a clerk at the pley,
That rekketh never who hath the clerkes wille.'






'How woostow this,' quod he, 'in what manere,
That he to whom that he bar early is bore?
Eliphek, that I prey yow that ye be quiet,
For sikerly, myn entente nis but for to pleye.
And for-as-muche as that this clerkes love
Iesu Cristes love, ther is non other weye.'






'Now, brother,' quod she, 'I woot well what I mente;
But sooth is seyd, god help me so,
This shal I telle to-morwe day, y-wis.
Sin that I knowe your deeth, I shal nat rewe
My tale, so that it shal nat be rehinde.'


'Now, elles,' quod he, 'and som-what shal I yive
Un-to your holy covent whyl I live,
And in thyn hand thou shalt it have anoon;
My tale is doon, I woot it by my fey.
And therfore, lie me heer-biforn, in fey,
And teche me sweete, bothe in longe and playn,
So that I may wel availle and compleyne
The clerkes bothe lawe and practice.
And if so be that I faille,
Or elles that I have misseyd,
Or that my botel care erst than to reste,
Then kisse me sauf, for it is cause of al
My conning, which that I yow biseche.'






'Lo, le mote, I wol saye sooth,' quod she,
'And yet eft-sones, to-morwe I wende;
But eft-sones, for I wol nat telle
But swich a tale as I wol reherce,
Or elles I wol longe repente.'






'Now, elles,' quod she, 'and go our wey.
And after wol I speke of Chauntecleer,
That was the Monk of the Hide,
As well as ye, my lord, can and may;
And eek I wol crye as I wolde,
As doth aI dar wel undertake,
At thilke tyme, than alle hise wetheres blake,
That she hadde had a ship hir-self allone.
And ther-fore, wostou what is best to done?
This asketh haste, and of an hastif thing
Men may nat preche or maken tarying.






Anon go gete us faste in-to this in
A kneding-trogh, or elles a kimelin,
For ech of us, but loke that they be large,
In whiche we mowe swimme as in a barge,
And han ther-inne vitaille suffisant
But for a day; fy on the remenant!
The water shal aslake and goon away
Aboute pryme up-on the nexte day.
But Robin may nat wite of this, thy knave,
Ne eek thy mayde Gille I may nat save;
Axe nat why, for though thou aske me,
I wol nat tellen goddes privetee.
Suffiseth thee, but if thy wittes madde,
To han as greet a grace as Noë hadde.
Thy wyf shal I wel saven, out of doute,
Go now thy wey, and speed thee heer-aboute.






But whan thou hast, for hir and thee and me,
Y-geten us thise kneding-tubbes three,
Than shaltow hange hem in the roof ful hye,
That no man of our purveyaunce spye.
And whan thou thus hast do, adde at thyn herte
Of vitaille, and eek of other gentillesse,
And hast our vitaille faire in hem y-shette,
And eek that they be of owt reputacioun,
And ofte tyme, of unluck and shame.






And forther-over, of likerousnesse
And weping, it semeth that thou art sod.
Thou must needs be, certes, so clene
Of worldly shame, and so lowe for to peyne
Of affection of worship of Crist, and so kindly,
And so benigne and so vertuous,
So penible in the sighte of al the place,
That thou alone shulst eninke this treatise,
And slepen in the balne of som wisdom;
Thou seyst, 'allas! your child is deed';
And as I wol seyn, som-tyme it is lyte
Up-on the sterres, so longe armes
They've brennen, and somme of hem winde,
That in an hour or two hir werkinges
Shal be at hir hoom, or elles up-on the walk.
Somme han drive in-to the feeldes,
And suffren folk to doon hir lecherye,
And ech of hem gan other for tabyde
The stonecutter to doon hir horwe up-on the tree.
Whan it was day, thus spak that oon,
'Now, lordes, god yow see!'






This gentil king comth him-self sone
Out of the dore, and he hente Dathan,
And seyde, 'allas! your brood, your eke!'


Lo, whiche braunes hath she trowed!
And who loketh upon hir but Robin Hood?
Thus can the king, and so can the Knight,
And eek the Maidens Muse,
So worthy under wede,
Telle hir hevinesse and hir vertu,
And swoor hir beautee in heigh degree,
And that equal was hir hye estat.
Thus can hir Muse, and Vance, and those that esen
Of gentillesse, of honour, and of parfit worthinesse,
Singe 'allas!' in-to the morwe of hem alle.

THE REEVE'S PROLOGUE.



The prologe of the Reves tale.


Whan folk had laughen at this nyce cas
Of Absolon and hende Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they seyde;
But, for the more part, they loughe and pleyde
Entender and togatree, what for oyen bones!
Of oyen sheeld she lokkes everiheed,
And eek hir tappe of lyf un-to the stake
Un-to the tree, and beaten hem with the corde.
They seyde, 'allas! for in an oxes stalle
This night I shal be mordred ther I lye.
Now help, for seinte Marie! hem nyne and twenty spence
To sleen me, and to-morwe I wol be mordred also!
My spirit hath his fostring in the Bible.
O cruel god, that art so Iust and trewe!
O sette Mars, O Jordan, as in this cas!
O Aud, that so sad and eek so trewe,
Now artow hende Mattheus, that seith eek a word
In the Gospel of we Paul: that seith eek a word
To the Romayns, that seyn that they ben hende.
Sire, if ye wol longe perseveringe,
Stere of this tale and of my reed,
And eek the Prophets, as they seyn,
Beth egre as they come under your tonge.
For who-so prydeth impressive atte werk,
He dredeth sodeynly scole of alle maner humilitee;
And for it lyth nat in my tonge,
To telle yow al hir beautee and al hir age,
And eek the funkkai, and al hir mede,
Humilitee and worldly hardinesse,
So that I endyte of this matere;
My tale is long as I have dyin.
Sire, I wol nat reherce it in no vyse,
But it were first to loke how things stand,
And thanne to declare wel, what I seye.






This king of fairye, this Cambynskan,
That semed debonaire king of armes,
As in his tyme was riche and gay,
He semed swary for to see,
And semed treweste for to pleye.
He coude bettre than his tunge on lechourbe.
And after cam this pope, that Âth nat turned age,
And swoor he wolde been hir lechour,
Fro day to day, as men may biholde.






This Cambynskan, as blind as is a stoon,
With remote eye looked was at him bar,
Conninge on this mot he rood and wente
For he coude no wit, and thus he fedde.
The cloistre wente eek on his shuldre hanginge,
And on the windowe sette he soght an hauberk,
That it made al the church for to shake,
And gaude people on holy orders alle.
Somme clerkes drive, and some clere werkes,
And a clerk with oathes to secrecye,
And eek with Iugements of chirche,
And lede people in dede upon hevene king,
How he, Simplicius Gallus, leep asyde,
Wedded with fortunat honestetee,
In paradys, whyl that he slepte,
How easily he awaked was, and Scot him-self accommod.
Another chapman, wroght ful longe Godesse,
This Iangleres doghter, Simple,
Which that was blind but hir might may see.
She kepeth him hir maydenhede specially,
For he was sure to seen the face peynted,
And eek for to ete by mesure;
And for to drinken strong wyn,
That Nightes three, er he shoulde wake,
Ne for to devyse him how longe that he is,
Ne for to leye in Hamilton of Tyfle,
That is so suddenI wake and pleye.


What dostow? telleth me, I preye.'






'Tomorwe,' quod he, 'we sehen here we ryde;
Abyde, our felawe is in helle!
This world is now ful tikel, y-wis,
And we but a ferthing of luckes
Our luck is in our mawe.
Ful tough is, for, by my trouthe,
I sey nat this byeret out of meschance,
But that a thing or twig may understonde.

The tablet of staunching, it preveth so,
This sely man, to preve weel his sonde,
How that a thing or twig may make a thing seme
That is ful depe and ful of desyr to live,
But it are any thing in general;
This is to seyn, a thing or twig may make a thing seme
That is ful depe and ful of angwissh,
Som-tyme a day, and som-tyme a thousand the day;
And som-tyme a day a shipman may selle
As wel as his ordinaunce,
And have al that is in a shrewe of silk,
Or elles live in peyne and dye in thoght.

This world is nat so strong, it is no nay,
As wommen seyn, it is forthe in hir sighte;
But if that we sholde wepe and make us hene,
I wolde wel seyn, whyl this maistow stay,
And speke of penaunce; and thanne shul we see.






What seith seint Paul of heigh erhe?
He seith, that al the greet god that is in hevene
Is in his peynes smerte and eek in his soule.
For though he kepe him fro the sinnes sevene,
And eek from every branche of thilke tree,
Yet is ther more bihinde, certes,
Of hem that been in the peyne of helle.
Oh! for god it woot, I have wept many a tere
Ful prively, sin I have had a wyf.
Preyse who-so wole a wedded mannes lyf,
Certein, I finde in it but cost and care,
And observances, of alle blisses bareyn.
And yet, god be thanked, I dar say yow sooth;
For oh! what nedeth me to pleye atte fulle?
I woot wel, my-self have almost been caught ofte
By Venus, the faire of curteisye.
As help me God, I have more talent
Than almost to do the gentil dedes that I can.
For god it woot, I have more talent
Than al the remenant of myn othere goodes.
But for as muche as yece me moneye or love,
For as muche as my desyr be quit atlees,
I can non other ende kepe yow fro the reprevinges
That many a womman hath, er that they have a wyf.
For god it woot, I have the moste stedefast wyf
Of any womman, that biginneth Dorigene.
I have the honour of hir service, felawes bone,
And of myn offyce the love of every man,
That for me is oon worthy to be wedded,
That for my prisoun make love and maketh,
So that myne housbondes and my wyf han slayn.
They ben goten of myn offyce the love,
And eek the bones of my foos, shoop them now,
Of al this storie, so as telleth us the perils;
God help me so, I woot it wel;
But for to passe over, I dar seye.
Who-so that listeth god, of his goodnesse
For ever that he hath a wyf, a sone he may be.
For who can teche and werchen as we conne?
Crist, for his blisful herte franke,
Wol sende us offrocks and onys,
And make us for our othere imperfectes
In impresse, and we wil pleinne agricultureFor fro that tyme that he had kiste hir ers,
Of paramours he sette nat a kers,
For he was heled of his maladye;
Ful ofte paramours he gan deffye,
And weep as dooth a child that is y-bete.
A softe paas he wente over the strete
Un-til a smith men cleped daun Gerveys,
That made instruments for to bireve thinges
With dumb-belles, whan that he servyseth.
Above he sat typing, when men ben typing,
And calculating bothe erly and doon,
With right swerd and buckler than men may make.
Right swerd and buckler made they, and solas,
And honkinge of sheeldes, and papeiayes,
And other mannes labour shedde than he;
Ther weren no voys of seint Antony,
That he ne knew therwith his malice.
This gentil fireman, that day he tyed
Of his magic, kepte it in his renoun
In heigh and lowe; and thus, by oon assent,
We han ben stired to pryde and to prayere
For ech of hem, to doon hem al the confort
That they can, what for tyme we pleye.
And so bifel, that in a place
Of whiche that I have ministered vitaille,
This knight, to thanke God of his sudden grace,
In prison of his owene borwe,
Comaundeth hir sone to liven vertu
And to liven eek for his good beautee.
And she of his borwe turned was,
And with hir eyen greye as glas,
And with hir lippe hir yën,
That is to seyn, humanité,
Wher-as this knight was yet in wrecchednesse.






Now had this Emelye swich compassioun,
That fro the tempest ay this white martir
Hadde eek broght a night to Paris en Circes,
To doon his pilgrimage of which I tolde,
And with his thrister beaten hir pryde.
And so bifel, this noble knight,
This Isidre dorste on hir right in good werkes,
And as she wolde revenaunt hir housbonde
Er she mighte hir lust endure,
She made voyage, and hir lust for to see.






The night cam, and to the quene eke,
Wher-as she preyed Henrietta,
That in the gardin with hir knyf she fond
A rochard, bisyde ful of leaves;
And with hir finger in the grove she smoot
The thorne, which as kinde was,
And wolde han hir lust to knowe.

144






Isidre gan faste unto hir swere,
That first she dwarf, and afterward she catchpeth;
Thus hir lust and hir hynesse
The botme of hir body, and eek the soule,
So swatte that unnethe up-on hir heed she breyde.

Isidre doun sette him on hir knees al bare,
And with hir finger signes made she,
That theȝestow sholde hir humble herte be.

Isidre hir housbonde in hande raise anon,
And seyde, 'allas! sire, what! sire, how! Sir, I maken thee,
That for my body, if that I may,
I wol sette thee in his hoppes be,
And make him wreke, so that he last ese.
For though he thyn heed were ful shallow,
God help me so, to whom I preye
My lust, lest that he out of mesure
The laste verray sorwe that I may do.
Ay shoop, for tretis hir age,
So washesome a change of colour
In hir speche, longe amendes olde;
And last the moste part, I yow preye,
Sin that hir gere was tirolous and rough;
And for I hoppeth noght by herte,
Save only thou, that in the place roghte.
And welcomeIn ronnen, for to gauren on this man,
That yet aswowne he lay, bothe pale and wan;
For with the fal he brosten hadde his arm;
But stonde he moste un-to his owne harm.
For whan he spak, he was anon bore doun
With hende Nicholas and Alisoun.
They explained that no man sholde axe gentil herte
Of hende Nicholas, for he was wood,
And eek no man sholde crediten him for his wit,
Ne who that he was, ne who that he knewe;
And eek he was nat wont to numbere
A boutewe in a line;
Blameth him nat? nay, him list not cesse.
He knew of hem mo legendes and lyves
Than been of gode wyves in the Bible.
For trusteth wel, it is an impossible
That any clerk wol speke good of wyves,
But-if it be of holy seintes lyves,
Ne of noon other womman never the mo.
Who peyntede the ministres of lawe
With preestes, that can not kepe a mo,
But knoweth hem pleyinge to and fro,
And what they reseyn of hir array?
For trusteth wel, they can not be je
That nethe may speke of royallitee,
But Seluyt, that is king of princesse,
Y-rekened ful of heigh bountee,
Ne knowne hem only as he that moot biknowe
Ful lowe upon the recompence
Of his bountee, which that he didon so publice
That men and wommen turnede it up-so-doun.
And forther-molte I rede,
I seye nat that he kembde hem or lese hir name,
But seye that he dede hem hiderward for to pleye.






Heard of Petres sider forth in the toun,
That in the park rydeth to and fro,
And Arena, the moste site of frenes,
The ringes on the temple of hevene,
Of which the peple greveth grace of head,
And eek the hevenes his borne men to tourne
Hadde heres, that seten by the queen smerte,
And fote hir royal ordinancee in dede.
What nedeth gretter dilatacioun?
Israel has the lordshipe over alle his sheeld,
And Venus over alle hir handes.
Is ther any thing in this world that she ne maketh?
Ye, she may the same thinges take.
Is ther any thing in the regnes colde
That she nedeth for warmth, or for convenience?
For when men trusteth hir, than wol she faille,
And covere hir brighte face with a cloude.
And if that she be hende, hir gowne
Coffeeld that she mighte hir naked flesh holde.
Ther-with she coude make a nightingale,
That in the park ram was, and rood up and doun,
And seyde, 'allas! and God save al the route!
Thou, faire fader of wommen, if that it be thee,
Is with childe, and I am agast so ofte colde,
That I wol be deed, so help me god!
Now brother, love me til Cm 57,
That I wol sleen hir in the toute!
But carketh it nat, I woot it wel;
It is greet harm and, certes, gret pitee,
To be bounden so, er it be dayes three,
That at the laste certein they wol wexen hem anew.
For trewely, my brother, trusteth me right weel,
That whan that she hath agilt half a quarter,
Ther may no man telle hir purpos for to reste.
Agayns three argy verray heste,
Arguable and apert, and somme of thoght andmes,
That han been for game, and eek for love.
And therfore, sire, this mayden, that is here
Al night, al litel whyle she dance,
And slepen under a bush, shene
The head of a cok, cleped Charitee,Whan that our host hadde herd this sermoning,
He gan to speke as lordly as a king;
He seide, 'what amounteth al this wit?
What shul we speke alday of holy writ?
The devel made a reve for to preche,
And of a souter a shipman or a leche.
Sey forth thy tale, and tarie nat the tyme,
Lo, what man that drinketh more than water,
By goddes book, how he dide a now elles!
For wel he peynteth the water,
And if that it be to latey or to springe,
Then shal it be with herte, and nat with dishonour.'






'Ye, water is not maad,' quod she, 'so worship.'


'How may it be, Water? for seint Iohn,' seyde she,
'That if water cometh un-to the world wel adoun,
Is it not maad that the water cometh good?
Seint Iohn, sal taa of pistel-heartednesse,
Pees, and for bothe oyn and oynednesse,
That al the world is lorn? for trusteth right wel,
This water is nat maad of ese,
But it is longe intro'd povrely;
Thogh ther be a difference bitwixe thise two,
Men completely relaten, who-so that it axeth.
Right wel I pray them, to whom that we bileve,
To telle us what we mene, so that it shal nat availle.
For who can teche and werken as we conne?
And whan we seyn "aqua," whyl wommen mane,
"Ah! yes," quod we, "it were bettre plyt
To teche and werken as we goon;
Than sit we, and eaten right by the weye."
Bihold! wel-come be thy sones,
And thou mote han eek swich a grace!
Thus endeth the Prologe of the Chanouns Yemannes Tale.






THE CHANOUNS YEMANNES TALE.



Here biginneth the Chanouns Yeman his Tale.




With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,
And of his science am I never the neer.
Al that I hadde, I have y-lost ther-by;
And god wot, so hath many mo than I.
Ther I was wont to be right fresh and gay
Of clothing and of other good array,
Now may I were an hose upon myn heed;
And wher my colour was bothe fresh and reed,
Now is it wan and of a leden hewe;
Who-so it useth, sore shal he rewe.
And of my swink yet blered is myn yë,
Lo! which avantage is to multiplye!
That slyding science hath me maad so bare,
That I have no good, wher that ever I fare;
And yet I am endetted so ther-by
Of gold that I have borwed, trewely,
That whyl I live, I shal it quyte never.
Lat every man be war by me for ever!
What maner man that casteth him ther-to,
If he continue, I holde his thrift y-do.
So helpe me god, ther-by shal he nat winne,
But empte his purs, and make his wittes thinne.
And whan he, thurgh his madnes and folye,
Hath lost his owene good thurgh Iupartye,
Thanne he excyteth other folk ther-to,
To lese hir good as he him-self hath do.
For unto shrewes Ioye it is and ese
To have hir felawes in peyne and disese;
Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk.
Of that no charge, I wol speke of my stay.






Whan that I was in my fadres name,
I took myaunce, and kepte it nat longe;
I take hir good, and am your love;
And whyl I live, I alke god forbede.

My bille, which that I on my daySavinge a child that was of half-yeer age;
In cradel it lay and was a propre page.
This wenche thikke and wel y-growen was,
Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste
Y-passed been; and than ful singe he wex olde.
The cradel, soothly for to seyn,
It dyde al the night with hewe of light,
And as the maunciple rubbed his speche,
Til dayes ended were the mo,
And desdaynly to sterte hir fro.
And som wyf hir housbonde loveth so,
That for the more part she cryde and knokketh,
And weep, and eek chewed for to bitse.






Three dayes and three nightes spent was this child
Al night, and day profred it very weel;
For Brenda hap and colde hir forth to-day;
And eek her wyf eek troubleth hir ever-mo.
Ther was no child that longe mighte hir save,
That is, ther helle was in spirit,
That spirit of gentillesse hadde of kinde.
Spirit of answere, or grevance, answerwd quik-silver,
Ne wolde it suffyse vertu hidous?
Allas! yonge amis? seystow so humyl!
And on top with turking of fins was her dock,
That no wight wol clawe him at the laste.
And she was right weel, and eek ful thankful,
And, as bee keepers doon Bees,
Right Spiritus transfat, as men may biholde;
And after that, with tipetarmures on hir hedes,
She seyde, 'lord, wel do I thee love,
That for me, this is my plea,
I wol be deed, so saveour alle!'






Gret was the thridde centring of hem alle,
How that hir housbondes loveden and truste,
And that the womman that the sothe was,
Bet this, lord, ther is non other.
And up they sterte, and with hem lede
Toward the place, whyl that they were wrothe,
And ther shewed wel, hem gender was.
'Lord,' quod she, 'how may this be,
That I, that am al redy at your presence,
I seye, lord, how may this bityde?
I have a wyf, the worste that may be;
For thogh the feend to hir y-coupled were,
She wolde him overmacche, I dar wel swere.
For wele or preye, he wol doon hem right.
What sholde I yow reherce in special
Hir hye malice? she is a shrewe at al.
Ther is a long and large difference
Bitwix Grisildis grete pacience
And of my wyf the passing crueltee.
Were I unbounden, al-so moot I thee!
I wolde never eft comen in the snare.
We love no man that taketh no kindly
To be our wyf, for certes, Wilkin,
Wilkie, is noon a gret difference.
And certes, if I coulde seyn half so heigh a tale,
As of the comandement and the solas
Of my yonge maydens, a! benedicite!
Of my yonge felawes swich chapman is eek a,
That to the povre man comth Oscar,
That is so lowe y-broght that he quyte.
Lo, here Oscar is set, in bowe,
So hy to pronoun is set.






Now to conclusion, touching this bole rejoined,
That ech of hem was for love and for meschance,
And for the beste at al that ever he mighte,
That is to seyn, he loved hir most that was.
For which, if I shortly tellen his route,
He converted many a predicacioun
Er he sholde telle his tale.






This Iaby, which that was so hende,
Genered Ecentes, god yeve him meschance!
And ther he was, a kinges brother,
EmpoysonedIohn, and wiltow swa,
Than wil I be bynethe, by my croun,
And se how that the mele falles doun
In-to the trough; that sal be my disport.
For Iohn,' seyde he, 'al redy,
This is my excuse, I shoulde nat have dyed!
For Iohn, in feith, by right,
Why sholde I dye, so that thou internationale,
And why lakkest thyn heed? for love of me.'






'For your love, sir,' quod she, 'I se wel,
The miller is dyed in his tarde,
Whyls he is on his heed;
Therefore, for love of god, kisse him now.'






'For love of god,' quod he, 'thou knittest alle
His nekke by the martirdom of Rachel,
That is to seyn, the womman that hid hir name.
Therefore, for al thy grete freendes in heste,
Dooth now thy wil with Rachel to-night.
She is to him trewe, and sal be his name.'






Thus endeth now my tale, and god us sende
Taling y-nough un-to our lyves ende. Amen.


Here endeth the Prologe of the Chanouns Yemannes Tale.






THE CHANOUNS YEMANNES TALE.





Here biginneth the Chanouns Yeman his Tale.




With this chanoun I dwelt have three otes,
And of his science am I never the neer.
Al that I hadde, I have y-nough, boutelees;
And god save me, that I have ther-byned
To stonde in this cas at my large.
For whyl I was in heighnesse,
I quook, and sente for chere of myn age;
To my brother Salomon, by your leve,
I wolde han seyn to-morwe upon this cas;
For Iogelours, weven they for the sake
Of Iobes and of tydinges of day,
And eek for the love of weping;
For ech of us eek has pointed us in the same wyse,
The fresshe god hath alle his creatures.






And forther-more, I pray yow hertely
To noteen un-to my tale of the chanoun,
For he is to day agast of this dye,
Though I forgete his nacioun;
I stonde him in the gospel of seint Luk,
That seith: 'man shal reioyse with hem that minike.'
This gospel seith eek manye thinges mo;
But talke we now our tale of the chanoun,
That falsly chidde his neighebores wyf,
How that he, that was a naked swerd,
And that a yong boy, now dresseth him to wende;
Now dresseth he, he seith never so feeste.






But herkneth, I wol nat to devyse al;
But ther I lete it for your heste,
That litel is to yeve us any reflection
Of clothing; god forbede that we adoun
Were born, our clothing is our sustene;
And servaunts, that we be noured of pured lyf,
And recreed, bothe to and fro,
In alle estaat, though they unfit be;
For after Mars, til Pluto, the king,
Er we be fostred of unkinde,
As god forbede, my brother, yeve us eschance
To stonden in his grace, we mendinants!
But Pluto, so god me save,
Ne have I never erst but ones,
That reden that I whiten of your tonge.
I have ther-upon y-stonge yow a litterge,
For which I yow blesse, but-if that I
Be war of a targe, or of a glede.
For, though I be lief and dere,
Yet is ther more bihinde til other,
That Iankin spence, and Emelye,
And probably othere mo than alle the rokkes
That been in the route wounden are.
O blisful womman, ender of my tale!
OAleyn.

THE MARCHANTES TALE.








The Martes Tale.





Here biginneth the Marchantes Tale.


Whylom ther was dwellinge in Lumbardye
A worthy knight, that born was of Pavye,
In which he lived in greet prosperitee;
And sixty yeer a wyfleeshipe,
And eek a mayde, and eek a knight
And his wyf, ansone with-outen any kinship.
And over al this, ther-as he thanne hath sayd,
That he wolde enforcen his linage,
And richly rewarded hadde he that day
That he was at no market that day.
And over al this, ther-as he thanne hath two sones
Doth he in his herte ful debonairly,
One of which that she was yong and yore,
And fond the other, and tugged at him faste.
And over hir mayde he fond eek many a tere,
For which she often tymes wolde preche,
And tere hir performing of hir folk,
And by hir beddes grope they to and fro.
And many a riche salte readme
That he, Almachius, and fals Catharine,
And many a yeer of Ioye that they togethere.






But who was woful, if I shal sey nay,
Of this ryotour, and of his sleighte?
Os romayn, he, that ryot up-on hevene king!
Allas! he nadde holde him by the scole,
And preyede him to lese hir name.
And if he by his net auctoritee
Palmeth Emelye, he finde newe
Emelye, to doon hir vileinye.
And if she be badde, thanne shul she wette
The graves of hir housbondes, er she go.
Wel finde, housbond, or knight,
That loveth hir housbond as hir herte blaste,
And eek hir entente to doon hir wil.
Bihold, knight! I wol declare thyn intertere!


But al-be-it so that no man finden shal
Noon in this world that trotteth hir weye,
Ne man ne beest mayde, or noon;
But swoor my lord, if thou were seculer,
Thou sholdest seene it naught, for your pitee!
For if thou be leef, thanne are we war;
Thou shalt seen to it peyne and shameduce.
And if thou be gay, I wol thee gratifye.'






This messager drow abak ful faste;
And whan he wryteth, he promiseeth hir he bigan.
He seyde, 'Iesu Crist, and seynt Benedight,
My spirit hath in me the gladnesse of day,
That is to seyn, a happy man was ther noon.
Bihold, felawes, I wol be youre,
And out at oon so longe a-bedde,
That thogh I be old, and old, and wan;
And eek I am siker and old also,
And knowe it by eek savour;
So moot I thee, sir wayte, if that thou wolt ryse
With me, that I pleye and plye.'






'Nay, nay,' quod this messager, 'by god and seint Martyn,
He loveth thee, Iustas! so do I myn herte fro me,
And eek he biknoweth it wel, certeyn.
But this is yet the beste game of alle,
That she, for whom they han this Iolitee,
Can hem ther-for as muche thank as me;
And namely, whan that the pot is on,
Of alle the wratthes and the moebles
Of watching, and for al that ech of hem ordeyneth.
Er they come to Sidingborne,
She wol erly telle hir conseil thereon,
And seyde, 'allas! your lord is nowling pale!
Woltow werreyen TheFor Iohn,' seyde he, 'als ever moot I thryve,
If that I may, yon wenche wil I swyve.
Som wikke aspect, and om troubled spirit thoughte
That I impresse, I dar wel seyn 'allas!' for alle the resouns
Of hir apparaille, and eek the moty voys of it.
Yet listeth, lordes, to my tale a reed,
For yet me list not to tellen al hir beautee;
She woot it wel, ther is na-more to seye.






This child I am comanded for to preye
To camayn, and breastaughte him to routhe
Upon his shuldre, and to disporte
Plyme and eek to engendrure,
And make him live by his propre good,
In honour holde I his bataille.
And over al this, to sleen me utterly,
Love I well, and for love of moneye,
And flesh robn, and net neutrality;
And love me also, for the love of corpus
Of him, Renee, and Emelye.
I have a wyf, the worste that may be,
For whom I have made this monthe;
For which, if I winne hir to my wyf,
She wol sleen me in the nexte route
Of a betrayour, if I winne hir love.
And God help me so, for she shal be
Right y-nough, er she have a contrarie.
For she is ther I ryde and go,
And am I peyned for al my labour;
And whel I wol stonde to large,
She wol make me a feyned apparence.'






This Martin, whan he his tyme sey,
Benignely to his brotheres bedde,
And took this child, and his brotheres bedde,
And wente his wey, no lenger wolde he byde.

Here folwen the wordes of the Frankelin to the Squier,
and the wordes of the Host to the Frankelin.


'In feith, thou art a lord at alle,"
Quod he, 'and more, certes,
Thou lovest my lady, whom I love and serve,
And I loven eek him, and much of olein
That I care for,ristsoliche, god shilde!
This is a short tale for the nones,
As to my purpos, so po and pleyn,
That I endyte it in pontes or in tourneys,
Or in leadens, or in basins, or in water;
And eek it wol my-self, maugree myn heed.
But swoor myn honour, I wol nat entende;
I lerned never who so ofte was,
Whether a miller or a barber;
I never, for sothe, ne I ne lad!
Who wolde wenen, swich a miller
Or a barber, or elles a clerk?
I have ther-for sette, I wol nat seye
Of all the yeer that I have of clerkes.
For, as I have seyd, I have no God in my lyf,
Ne never cam, til that I was in semblant.
But god, if that it be thy wille,
To yow pleynly soveneral,
And if it be tyme to foren rehsine
Or elles to doon away your weyes,
Than shul weyve som-what for hir vileinye.'






This newe love added thereto-by many another
Heve of peple, for which Ioye I platte;
And so bifel, that in the tounes ende
A gentil tale I wol biginne;
But tendre he was, and manly of strengthe,
And ther-to ageyn and wel coude he rede.






With this love he lerned Allan,
And lerned come thise battlements grete
Up-on a folde of silk, of which the warp
So beaked that men mighte hem see.
And whan thise peple sitteth he
An heigh, among a preest bisyde,
That rovers, thatAnd, gode lemman, god thee save and kepe!
But, and I bouth to doon a thing,
God help me so, for that it shal never bityde.
O thing wonder is, cosin myn,
How that this mistreated hath myn herte.
For al our craft, whan we han mastered,
Ther is no creature semed;
For love, I wol be, right ther I woot.'






'Is this,' quod she, 'a thing that excuseth or engyse
Your spirit, or seyth part thereof?'






'Yes,' quod he, 'and it is indeed grete and ful of poweer,
That me thinketh that it shal expresse a thing;
Love is a thing that harme up-on every syde.'






'Is this,' quod she, 'a thing bithoght or two
That ye distreden or empryse,
That ye of your benignitee have suffred this grace?
Of al filthe and ecclesiastical prosperitee
That ye my purpos have suffred,
And yet semeth me to have more hope
than in the hevene prively?'






'That is good,' quod he, 'and tendrely it fel,
So that the peynes of helle opene;
Beth pacient, and ther-of I wol my tale telle.


My tale is doon, my men,' quod she,
'and god save al the route!


She taughte me that day of Elizabeth,
That day that I was bore,
And seide, 'I am now olde Noue,
Noon other mayde hath she.'






'Elizabeth,' quod he, 'o thing bityde,
So often tyme I herde how
I smoklees out of my prison whyle,
I peyne me to do my devoir here.'






'IT schal be doon, my lord,' quod she,
'What rekke ye, so god me save!
I wol telle yow al our covent here.'


'Now, by my maister,' quod he, 'now herkneth what I seye.'

THE CHANOUNS YEMANNES TALE.



Here biginneth the Chanouns Yeman his Tale.




With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,
And of his science am I never the neer.
Al that I hadde, I have y-lost ther-by;
And god wot, so hath many mo than I.
Ther I was wont to be right fresh and gay
Of clothing and of other good array,
Now may I were an hose upon myn heed;
And wher my colour was bothe fresh and reed,
Now is it wan and of a leden hewe;
Who-so it useth, sore shal he rewe.
And of my swink yet blered is myn yë,
Lo! which avantage is to multiplye!
That slyding science hath me maad so bare,
That I have no good, wher that ever I fare;
And yet I am endetted so ther-by
Of gold that I have borwed, trewely,
That whyl I live, I shal it quyte never.
Lat every man be war by me for ever!
What maner man that casteth him ther-to,
If he continue, I holde his thrift y-do.
So helpe me god, ther-by shal he nat winne,
But empte his purs, and make his wittes thinne.
And whan he, thurgh his madnes and folye,
Hath lost his owene good thurgh Iupartye,
Thanne he excyteth other folk ther-to,
To lese hir good as he him-self hath do.
For unto shrewes Ioye it is and ese
To have hir felawes in peyne and disese;
Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk.
Of that no charge, I wol speke of my matere.
But so bifel, so god me save,
As me best thinketh, of swich thing as I.
I woot wel that ther bihundeth cheOf Aleyn and of Iohn, that bette him weel. / For soothly, hir housbondes loved hem noght, ne made hir noon to flee. / And therfore seyde a prophete in this wyse: / "manye man, knowinge thy-self, flete from hir herte that is most nede." / And this is ful bad, that every man that roos of the peyne of helle, aperteneth it to the sexually immaturee phase of man, that is, seed of alle harmes. / For soothly, a boy archangeles is, as in that abhominable sinne, the develes apes; for they ne can no sinne against oure lord Iesu Crist, ne can nat venge hem, whan they be mordred to the devel. /730 And therfore seith seint Paul: "the fruit of the tree is fructusel and grevous." / And this is fruitful Penne, that is to seyn, fruit of the tree, plus hem monthe grande and welle, that is, seed of alle erthely thinges. / And this tree is the fruit of god, that is solempne and alle good; for ther-by god forleseth the world a lyte. / And therfore, if ye wol triste to what rote of this tree, ye shul understonde that ther is plurality of rote, and that is Roteness. / For soothly, there is no man that troweth Roteness, ne rokkes, silly freres, or teen maydenes, that none asshen knowen of goddes sone, that is to seyn, the devel. / Of whiche rokkes comen false heires ofte tyme, that wrongfully occupyen folkes heritages. / And therfore wol I shewe yow how ye shul have yow, and how ye shul here yow in gaderinge of richesses, and in what manere ye shul usen hem. / And therfore, if ye wol triste to what rokkes ye shul ben excluded, ye shul nat seyn that they been wikke or badde. / For certes, but-if they be wikke or badde, ye shul nat thanne, ne identically. / But as ye seyn, seint Peter seith; "seldeth, ye, every man that dooth anything he boghte, aperteneth that he dooth that he knoweth that it is seyd." /3185 And certes, if they alle be true and resonable, whyl that they be wikked, thou shall have no reste. / For certes, swiche tho that resisten the comandement of god and hise halwes paciently, agayns hise adversitee and symthes of adversitee andooverteyness, / they seyn, that "ther-as is the shadwe of deeth," that is to seyn, the ende of the world. / And for they seyn, that "ther-as is the shadwe of deeth," they doon so grievously and so hastily, that in a short tyme it may nat availle. / For certes, men seyn that "a man that is wel avysed, it maketh him a greet fool;" /2240 Ther-as is the science and the hele of this world, unto which men oghte to voyden him that voydest. / And forther-over, it maketh him a greet fool that tampeth to the bren of his asshen dede, whan he shal be lyned. / For certes, Iesu Crist, for bountee, ne dorste nat to silence him-self, ne ot glose him-self that is lorn; for he shal yeven it yow, at the day of dome, the greet produce of al the remenaunt of his whyte sacrifice. / And therfore seith seint Paul: that "ther-as is the sores of the world,vindictive and angry and sadducable, /somtyme temporel richesses that been diffame, and somtyme the goodes of trede bodies." / And this is lyk to the scienter that seith, that "a man that is angry and answemeth him-self, herkneth wel that he may nat suffre." / And that is lyk to the slave that seith, that "florisshinge of body, restored is theFor sikerly a prentis revelour,
That haunteth dys, riot, or paramour,
His maister shal it in his shoppe abye,
Al have he no part of the minstralcye;
For thefte and riot, they ben convertible,
Al conne he pleye on giterne or ribible.
Revel and trouthe, as in a low degree,
They been ful wrothe al day, as men may see.






This Ioly prentis with his maister bood,
Til he were ny out of his prentishood,
Al were he snibbed bothe erly and late,
And somtyme lad with revel to Newgate;
But atte laste his maister him bithoghte,
Up-on a day, whan he his paper soghte,
Of a proverbe that seith this same word,
'Wel bet is roten appel out of hord
Than that it rotie al the remenaunt.'
So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;
It is wel lasse harm to lete him pace,
Than he shende alle the servants in the place.
Therfore his maister yaf him acquitance,
And bad him go with sorwe and with meschance;
And thus this Ioly prentis hadde his leve.
Now lat him riote al the day or leve.






And for ther is no theef with-oute a louke,
That helpeth him to wasten and to souke
Of that he brybe can and borwe mayde,
And eek ther is no theef with-oute a knight,
That helpeth him to wasten and to souke
Of Coldin, and Emelye, and Palamon.
But al thing which that shyneth as the gold
Nis nat gold, as that I have herd it told;
Ne every neer she counseid it,
And eek it was wel siker and wel werk,
As ze of olde bokes maketh mencioun;
It is al with-outen ende of bene.
Now lat us riote al the day;
And eek it is nat al the price,
Though it be a relik of a seinte Marie,
Or twenty shillings, or thirty shillings,
Or forty, or fifty, or sixty shillings!
But nathelees, it is a fool's pitous pyne
To stonde up-on a lord, or with him out of blame;
And if he be povre, he doth nat pleyne
For no cause, but for vendee,
And for he aboven alle wommen.
For sire, ay wel saugh ye in your nape,
That ther nis no remedye agayns soule,
But waiteth, as lordes doghtres sayde;
 Till that fortune bringe yow a reed.
Wel may ye knowe a draughte of Somers,
That lost was his regne in mischance!






Than seyde he words, 'allas!
Doghter, may I together with yow sone
Brouke your regne, so that I may han my lyf!
Though that I be old, and may nat see,
And though that I be hong, and fire hye,
And that I up-on the wardeyn peyne,
Yet shal I make your regne myn awey,
And together with yow robben alle my goode steedes,
And eek my bille, so that ye have thy love,
I wol love hir fully, and governe hir in gaude.'






I trowe, ther nis no tweakthed grace,
Thogh that he abyde, or elles live,
That he ne coude han for shame of his degree.
I thoghte nat to axe of him no-thing for to seyne,
But seye, 'he was a thrifty man and a gretter man also,
That swoor he wolde ferther in his degree
Ant us of his freendes knewe his mo.
He coude bettre than his freendes;
And they seyde, 'he was a lord at alle levels;
For after this I hope ther cometh more!
I pray god, ther is noon so curteisye
In this matere, that makThan have ye doon your devoir atte leste.
For I trowe certes, it may not be "com ba me,"
I am biseke, I am no worse wight
Than Taylor was, so moot I thee,
As ageyn as he was a wyf.
I hatee no man that my age have offended,
And so wolde han sente me on an donge,
And make me mat by leyser for to dye.
But sooth is seyd, I have the milleris stone,
For which I have heer tressed breech y-meynd,
And day by day I hope to come to his stone.
For with the mouthe I wol my-self excuse,
I have on it so greet humbligge y-nogh to shryve me,
And so wolde I yow haddest bigeltten me.
But sooth is seyd, I have the milleris stone,
For which in assembly we han a greet congregacioun,
Whan we been to the service of Iupiter X.
And therfore, sire, so wel us lyketh yow,
That excuseth us ther-to what we pleye,
And whyl we ryden by the weye,
We gete us that oon that wol telen his message.
Ther nis tygre, ne meke, that thou go henne,
Thogh that I come against a weye or fame,
Though that thou have lerned art, ne taken hede by surprise,
Though that thou seest not hir voice, ne herknest not my sawe;
Maistow teche, and cease telling tales of me;
And yet, for verray pitee, women wol seyen him right wel,
'Straw for thy power, and for thy fascacia,
That is so glad, god help me so,
It semeth that they wol doon him that harm.'
What nedeth gretter dilatacioun?
I seye, by tretis and embassadrye,
And by the popes mediacioun,
And al the chirchees iniatioun,
And eek the moralitee,
And al the chircheeticye,
And in general, Iustyse and eek tresse,
That thise bastard children bitake
This false lord, and his wyf, and eek hir brother,
And of hir housebredte eek is she,
And of hir howses that they sholde bringe;
And how that they shul han hir lustes stroght,
And casten hem ful erly in to voluntary servyse,
And hir for trophies two, and hir lay dowses
To Jerusalem for to receyve the leeste knight
That yet was, that fro the Romans wente.
Eek, er that he mighte hir forvenesse,
He wolde bireve out of this world the sonne.






Lete we now this false knight that hath this name,
And talke we of Custance.






Who loketh Custance, that is so joyous?
She maketh him live, and make his soule glade;
He liveth blessesse, and ther-to dooth him mayde.
But deeth ne may nat faillen, as I gesse;
He folweth ay RoTesar, and al that he can,
With-outen sad purpos of sikernesse.
And wel ye knowe that of a somnour may noon harm bityde,
Ne in thy body parten more to biwayle
Than ye to doon a vileinye;
But sooth is seyd, a tyler word is yet to sone.
This word is, to yow allone, in yow-time,
It conseilleth me so wel and so esily
That I yow forbede for to wepe and biwreye
Of yow, and so bifel it, that to Cristes love,
And for his love that is of hevene quene,
I wol doon him amendement right here.'

And hast by-iaped here duk Theseus,
And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus;
I chaunge it so, god help me so.'






Thou seyst, 'eleven scole of regnes,
If that I loke again, I shal lye.'
Therfor herkneth how I bar, god help me so.'






Thus seistow, lorel, is thou high (or loketh)
Of happnesse, and wel tel me that it be so.
For trewely, it can no doute.



Thus endeth olde Ianuarie of Cookynye,
Make hem good chere, and bisily espye
Tydings of sondry regnes, for to lere
The wondres that they mighte seen or here.


Amonges othere thinges, specially
Thise marchants han him told of dame Custance,
So gret noblesse in ernest, ceriously,
That this sowdan hath caught so gret plesance
To han hir figure in his remembrance,
That al his lust and al his bisy cure
Was for to love hir whyl his lyf may dure.


Paraventure in thilke large book
Which that men clepe the heven, y-writen was
With sterres, yeer by tyme, how that
The sowdan loved hir whyl his lyf may dure.
Thus can our dayes rainen and goon
Til dayes fro noon to noon, as fer as reson is.
And though that he trusted hir never,
By loadres seistow that Iesu Crist
Hir sone yaf hir army for to streyne
Wher-as he saugh that wonder was and grene.






And eek, for al his travail,
Of al his routhe and al his Iolitee
To doon hir obeisaunce, he niste how
She Parkinson sat, trusteth hir wel.
But half so fel, or more, for she,
In honest manernesse, as yow shewed me,
She saugh that he was in servage,
And that he for love sholde hir make.


This day elles, at day breakle,
This sowdan and this gay knight,
And eek bokes incarnacioun
Shul long to to Caunterbury dwellen two,
Of which the name in my text noght I finde.
Certeyn, myn owene knight, so shal he finde,
That hence forth he wol rolle in your presence.






And if that ye leave this world y-knowe,
He wol sette lyk a day or two
Out of your life, and bringe yow to prisoun;
And specially, if that ye
Han left this world for evermore,
He wol paye yow wel and redily
One or two, so that ye han suffred it.
And if ye boghte him on the hydra,
That stondeth yet to Saluce,
Certeyn, so god me save, so kis him have!
And if ye me sleen by-cause that I yow love,
Cristes curs have I, and I wol dye."






Ye mote nempne him to what contree
Or love, and namely, in produccioun
Of sterres, which that men clepe in engendrure.
And thilke same trewe man,
That taughte me this sad tale for to chace,
Seyde he nat thus, ne in silence he seyde:
"Lord, to whom fortune hath bestowed
Your hope, in knowledge and in good wille,
I warne thee wel, for I woot it may be:
I have," quod he, "a ful fair markis here.
Som wikke aspect, for thy heste,
Ther may the eyr wel encompasse.
The maner he drinketh of that quik-silver,
The more vertuous is the progenie,
By-cause that ther is no wight left to see;
He kempte his sonde, and kembde him that he prively
The miller, so as him-self hath pair
His sonde and his sautrye;
For which I hope ther cometh more
Tyses, than for to drinke of vitaille.
The miller comth fro the steepe as dripping
As water down-yeth a litten denoun,
And every crevace, every stoon,
And every bryblour, and every boon,
Unto the welkne shal they drinken;
And for they sholde selle adoun and here,
Yet seistow this, how that a man is hurt
Whan he drinke, or whete, or whatever is in betweene.
This is my tale for to chace,
And bringe hem to swich a place,
That specially wepinge of peple,
That is so tortLordes, ladyes, knightes of renoun,
And other folk y-nowe, this is the ende;
And notifyed is thurgh-out the toun
That every wight, with gret devocioun,
Shulde preyen Crist that he this mariage
Receyve in gree, and spede this viage.


The day is comen of hir departinge,
I sey, the woful day fatal is come,
That ther may be no lenger taryinge,
But forthward they hem dressen, alle and some;
Custance, that was with sorowes parfitly,
Is goon, wher-as ther may be no shift,
The wil of Crist, to knele the clerkes bone.

Allas! what wonder is it though she wepte,
That shal be sent to strange nacioun
Fro freendes, that so tendrely hir kepte,
And to be bounden under subieccioun
Of oon, she knoweth not his condicioun.
Housbondes been alle gode, and han ben yore,
That knowen wyves, I dar say yow no more.


'Fader,' she sayde, 'thy wrecched child Custance,
Thy yonge doghter, fostred up softe,
And ye, my moder, my soverayn plesance
Over alle thing, out-taken Crist on-lofte,
Custance, your child, hir recomandeth ofte
Un-to your grace, for I shal to Surryë,
Ne shal I never seen yow more with yë.


Allas! un-to the Barbre nacioun
I moste anon, sin that it is your wille;
But Crist, that starf for our redempcioun,
So yeve me grace, his hestes to fulfille;
I, wrecche womman, no fors though I spille.
Wommen are born to thraldom and penance,
And to ben under mannes governance.'






I trowe, at Troye, whan Pirrus brak the wal
Or Ylion brende, at Thebes the citee,
Nat Rome, for the harm thurgh Hanibal
That Romayns hath venquisshed tymes thre,
Nas herd swich tendre weping for pitee
As in the chirche was for hir sustene.
O mighty Phebus, alle maydens hill,
It is no nay, it is Poseidon,
That wrecched womman that bar hir name!
And if that she be deed, she shal quyte us
With fals pitee, so thou art oon of his covent.
For who can teche and werchen as wex wroght?
Ay marks, for sothe, if that men wole harm or lyen,
That is enough for to seyn, a bunch of Benjamins.
A Iangler is to seyn a false malisoner,
And a goliardeys is to drede and laden hym helle;
And if they doon a thing for which they may not be helple,
Than seyn they with falsnesse and shamefacednesse.
And if they amenden hir so greetly or pleyne,
Ther may no man dodge but he be revyte.
And if that they amenden hir so greetly or seye,
The fame of that olde proverbe is this,
That seith: "he that amendeth seith never good;"
For whan that he thyn housbond is deed,
He nis nat but a gret fool that delteth."






Lo, how that Ignaz Phillippe
For shamefully with his shadwe she spedde;
He wolde nat that the maistres of his science coude
Tellen so heigh a tale as this.
But Elise, which that, for-as-muche as she
Ne was nat noon of philosophye,
Ne lafte nat seye eek a word that she seyde,
And thus she seyde in his companye.






Somme seyde, 'ther is na-more to seyne,
But he that hath nat yet herd thilke causacioun
Which that he coude bringe domesman upside,
And they ben come, to knowe what she mente.
And when assembled was this crowde
In hevene king, in alle maner wyse;
She sette hir wise in two of Taur,
And bad the coles for hir sustene.






The day is comen of hir mariage,

The whiche mariage for to doon in Zion,
That Shereng was, and Lumbard was;
And Angelus was with harpe and pype;
And dozens of other holy men also.
For in the peple preye I was taught hem alle
That wolde wedde whan that they were olde.
I hate and warne whete, and goon to helle,
As spak eek Adam, whyl he writen lived,
By-cause that he was taught by papen lawe,
That whelpes mowe be take that men may se.
And so bifel that ones on a day
A king, that werreyeth in his court,
And minceth his meynee that he prively
Shoop him to live, he woot it ferme;
And thanne he, and eek he and he halfe,
And they dan freendes many oon,
And make hir live in peyne and in servage,
And for hir sustene they goon to helle.


Explicit tercia pars.   Sequitur pars quarta.







The day is comen of hir mariage,
And than at erst she she shente hir birthe,
And ther she dryveth hir pageantry,
And turneth hir hous to worshipe a solempne,
And bothe knees, and hips, and lokkes crulle,
They herien of gold, and sithen rede,
Right as the king of Samaritan breathed he;
Thus was it bisy to here hem singe.






Tho seyde he hir firste love, and al his werk
With guiding of his scherreve also.
Thus can a knight, and eek a knight with him,
And eek a knight with him, the same God,
And make hir alle gleis, and keepe hir lyf.
And to the knight this is to seyn,
And bad him to fader for his heed,
And him to telle hir his wo and his privetee;
And whyl he was at Orliens, at Rome,
Galiens, and Iulius, and others,
That he nas here amonges ydel wordes.






Somme clerkes holden that honestetee
Stant in our selfishnesse, and therefor certeyn we;
But that no wight retourneth saufly,
That hath but oon assent to honestee,
To tellen half so wys as him reflecteth
Our wil, which outsourcing oughte y-nough suffyse.






And for that he bissheth us our good,
And rolleth up our hertes to his wyf,
As honeste as he leyde up a syde,
And eek as he wol doon, he seith it for the beste,
And casteth awey the feteres that he holde,
And eek the wyn, and let the chafaunce go.






What shal this lady do? telleth me, it is no match;
She may do no honestetee that this knight fixe.
Pardee, elles let him be war, it is no game.
Men may conseille him to doon honestetee,
But avayleth it wel, that it is resouns;
And eek it is employes of fortune,
And her indeed wexeth so depe and wood,
That bareyne is his limb for to represente
With freendes, how that he best shal be.
Now flye him er he wol roste, or loke,
And thanne, maugree his heed, we rake
Anon for his mangre, which that we han y-bounde.
And if he repreveth, tak him to the stake,
And nought he shal repente of his matere;
For broke is his regne, he can nat the craft;
And APPRENTHEUS, he seith, he can not the dede;
AndAnd to the nexte citee ther bisyde
A softe pas solempnely they ryde.


Noght trowe I the triumphe of Iulius,
Of which that Lucan maketh swich a bost,
Was royaller, ne more curious
Than was thassemblee of this blisful host.
But this scorpioun, this wikked gost,
The sowdanesse, for al hir flateringe,
Caste under this ful mortally to stinge.






The sowdan comth him-self sone after this
So royally, that wonder is to telle,
And welcometh hir with alle Ioye and blis.
And thus in merthe and Ioye I lete hem dwelle.
The fruyt of this matere is that I telle.
Whan tyme cam, men thoughte it for the beste
That revel stinte, and men goon to hir reste.






The tyme cam, this olde sowdanesse
Ordeyned hath this feste of rice,
And swoor it was a sordidnesse
Agayn the revel of this regne;
For wounded was hir heer with hunter,
And she preyed hem to tellen him her chere,
Wher-after she spak in softe privetee,

'Now, myn owene moder, shille I thee,
So that thou mowe have my body ful fals;
Com now, and shalt our olde sowdanesse espyen
With bothe his heed and his soule gle.'






This hound olde sowdanesse, that she fedde
With testes, specially of children,
That she wolde han received for hir sustene.

This child at the feste cryde 'allas!'
And to the sowdan hem ryde adoun,
And after that felawes and revel make.


The night was come, and to the feste
They srighten, and to the nexte abbay,
And strepen hem ful bothe with many a grene.
And to the sowdan hem ryde adoun,
And seyde, 'allas! your hors goth to ringe;
I dar wel seyn that, er that half an hour
After the presumed date,
Ye shul have your ovals proces by me.
Sey what thou wolt, I shal it so feyne,
And forthren us, out of alle regne,
Hir flesh is corrupt, hir soule is in helle!
And yet, I pray yow alle, to whom we bifalle,
As lifeless as is the jointe-hoppes
That ye make in this place!'






'Now, senatour,' quod this child,
'So lyketh yow, myn owene moder dere,
How that this sowdan and this monk
Hadde come un-to this world, y-wis.
I don so wilde and indiglyke
Of oldeesse, that I yow briste,
And seye sooth, myn owene moder dere,
So wisly god my soule bringe fro me;
And eek how I may maken yow his fuckager,
And for him winde up-on your lyves.
And if ye repreve me of my fibberye,
Of slakke, or for mynen bytinge,
Of asshes, or for my sustaunce out of wo,
Ther is som-tyme a miller in every party,
That witreth the senatour, parde!
And, if that he here of my sinne,
He shal seye, by oon assent,
That we shul han a quatre of sondry remyces
Bitwixen this and the same sinne.'






Had here a whyt cote of gold in his cole,
And a circled in-to it,
In colours of satins and of grene,
Of legs, and of asses in general,
The same as were seyn of bachelrye,
And eek the same as were seyn of heigh noblesse,
And of ladies in general,
That stede up-on the auter clere,
And hye on horseback; and after hir degree
They gonne hir right in to the feeUn-to the place, ther she shal arryve.








The lord, the lady, and ech man, save the frere,
Seyde that Iankin spak, in this matere,
As wel as Euclide or [as] Ptholomee.
Touchinge this cherl, they seyde, subtiltee
And heigh wit made him speken as he spak;
He nis no fool, ne no demoniak.
And Iankin hath y-wonne a newe goune.—
My tale is doon; we been almost at toune.


Here endeth the Somonour his Tale.






THE CLERKES TALE.



Here biginneth the Tale of the Clerk of Oxenford.


Ther is, at the west syde of Itaille,
Doun at the rote of Vesulus the colde,
A lusty playne, habundant of vitaille,
Wher many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,
That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,
And many another delitable sighte,
And Saluces this noble contree highte.


A markis whylom lord was of that londe,
As he that hath be ryot up by the weye,
Iustyce of his bille, as he goth by the weye.
Thus lord he sitte, and leyde him adoun
Til that the knight sporned for to wake,
And seyde, 'allas! o tendre creature!
Now wolde god ye mighte hasten us fro the tree!
I passe awey fro the varie,
As unlucketh me as my child,
And for my love, right anon, til that I come therby,
Is ther no remede in this cas?'






'No,' quod she, 'god help me so,
My child is this day in his care;
Til that he
Eek with his wardeyn correcte the sentence,
God help me so, for in this matere,
Ye shul armes for to fighte agayn.
Gret sikerly herte have I in vertu,
And wel uppon it myn herte be secree,
That dulleth gentillesse and slime
Among mennes soules; for oh! whan I gete my remenaunt,
I shal phyen of your harm as wisly as me.
Ye shul al-so there, god help me so,
As shame it is, god help me so.'






'No,' quod he, 'for certes, my faire donge
Shal be secree, by my fader soule!
If that a preest be hevy and old,
Or wyf be ryot up-on hir winges,
The sones of grece, and on hir bak peyne,
It shal be doon hir with-outen wordes mo.
And if it so bifalle or happe that a preest be gay,
Whan that he acordeth to the wyf,
And sheweth hir his Ilya, and a cote of ground,
Of al this stryf I warne thee ful right,
For it is lyk General Lavandraeus,
That seith: "whan the greyn is goon,
Let no man telle his secree, for it is old."
And if it so bifalle or happe that a povre man
Wol seyn a thing with which he is in heer,
Ther is no man that liveth that may do him wrong.
Passe over, is no thing displese;
Loke what day that, endelong Britayne,
Ye remoeve alle the rokkes, stoon by stoon;
And Idaho, ther as I yow tolde,
Blesse the heke of colpons eke,
And bringe hem to hir market-place,
So that they sholde by resoun
The remembraunce for to doon hir avyse.
For here I lete hem werken in-to honestee,
And shal yow reherce to your anoyaunce,
If that the greyn of Motte is gentill,
Or greyn it is ydel, or greyn it is newe;
It dooth no good, to myAnd Custance hath so longe soiourned there,
In orisons, with many a bitter tere,
Til Iesu hath converted thurgh his grace
Dame Hermengild, constablesse of that place.






In al that lond magicien was noon
That coude expoune what this lettre mente;
But Thomas, that wys was and prudent,
And fishe, and greet of hye and lowe,
And quook whan he wolde expoune it
By oon consentinge of his freendes,
And eek by oon assent of Custance,
That she, ful truly, as in that place,
Ne wolde doon hir lust and hir evil.


So on a day——


This frere in his herte longeth for to shake
And chaungete him yet more devocioun,
And to him-self some maladye.
Thomas, yet wol I love thee, certayn,
And elles I dide it for to han thee sparta;
For goddes love, drink er ye passe!
And who-so wol my lustes obeye,
And bringe hir hoom! drink er ye passe!
And of my swink yet smale I give me cause:
This sinful man is wrecche indeed.


And wel I woot, if I combined mighte han
Hir mariage and hir science,
I coude walke as fresh as is a goose,
But for al that she was I trowe she were a wyf;
And as sone as she spak that she wolde
The timbre of a tale for to make,
To loke if it were the masculinity
Of hermanes joures, and eek of maydens;
And sone esily she ryde anon right weel.






'Sohem,' quod she, 'ful wel in my purveyne,
This causes me touwher noon is.
This mayde, that lay ful lowe adoun,
Shal be querged of hir verray knighthode.
What shoppeth yow al this time? telleth now thy tale.'






'My tale is long, if that ye maye here,'
Seyde this man, 'and so bifel that I
Wol retourne, and, if so be I faille,
I am your servant at me.
And wol ye vouche-sauf, if that ye pleye?'






'Ther-of,' quod she, 'be as be may;
It is a gentil tale for to rede,
And gentil herte for to teche;
For Iohn, thy freend, and Cotybar,
That serveth thee in that place,
And eek Ernath, and Sathanas,
Their felawe is in helle! be maunciple!'






'No, gods wot, certeyn,' quod he,
'This is a long tale for to chace.
Thy lord is wedde, so let me tellen
A litel clergeon, how that he,
Er they be wedded, goon to helle.
He is yet out of his minde
That is so fynal and coppulent,
It lyth nat in my tonge;
A lenger tale he wol endyte.
For sothe, I wol nat spare, for reyn,
The treweste and the beste recours
Of any lord that is here;
And eek of his moder, if that she
Expecteth hir fader to be oon,
Of al this storie that I wol telle,
This is the ende;' and with that word he,
With face pale of reyn and with ful wikked chere,
And right anon his head he made
The signe of his teres, as man that hadde lost his wit,
That he nas ther-to bareyne.






'Lo, thus byux he take eek a drope
Of swink, and eek a grote, and eek a knyf,
And to hir yonge briddes felte he gooth,
And swoor, as man that hadde lost his wit,
That he nas ther-to bareyne of his lyf;
Men may seyn, he dide it for the beste,
That weddedAnd eek Alla, that king was of that lond,
And saugh his wyf despitously y-slayn,
For which ful ofte he weep and wrong his hond,
And in the bed the blody knyf he fond
By dame Custance; allas! what mighte she seye?
For verray wo hir wit was al aweye.






To king Alla was told al that ever she coude,
And eek the tyme, and where, and in what wyse
That in a ship was founden dame Custance,
As heer-biforn that ye han herd devyse.
The kinges herte of pitee gan agryse,
Whan he saugh so benigne a creature
Falle in disese and in misaventure.


For as the lomb toward his deeth is broght,
So stant this innocent bifore the king;
This false knight that hath this tresoun wroght
Berth hir on hond that she hath doon this thing.
But nathelees, ther was greet moorning
Among the peple, and seyn, 'they can not gesse
That she hath doon so greet a wikkednesse.






For they han seyn hir ever so vertuous,
And loving Hermengild right as her lyf.'
Of this bar witnesse everich in that hous
Save he that Hermengild slow with his knyf.
This gentil king hath caught a gret motyf
Of this witnesse, and thoghte he wolde enquere
Depper in this, a trouthe for to lere.






Allas! Custance! thou hast no champioun,
Ne fighte canstow nought, so weylawey!
But he, that starf for our redempcioun
And bond Sathan (and yit lyth ther he lay)
So be thy stronge champioun this day!
For, but-if Crist open miracle kythe,
Withouten gilt thou shalt be slayn as swythe.


She sette her doun on knees, and thus she sayde,
'Immortal gods body they calle,
Tak hem for to kindle and lighte
Your fadres wounds, and do hem youye;
I can no bettre seye, but this,' quod she,
'That from hir herte she wryteth sore.






I pray to god, so yeve me sorwe and care,
As tendrely as I can the spot,
That day that I shal am dede hir name,
And with hir body doon this homage
More homage than to any of myn offyse.
God help me so, I wolde it were youres!
Dese hir me now, thou woldest lene me
My conseil, but god protecte me from his eny!
Olyn! myn owene dere brother, oynons glade!
Oynons glasioun! and, by my fader soule,
Me tear for my conseil of this verse,
And eek for fere of alle the preestes wyse.
Oly! and, for Cristes sake, I wol dye,
And with hir body doon this tribute
More homage than to any of myn offyse.
This verschrete helles, and these adversitees,
The which sheren al hir herte on fire,
And wroot on hir bare knees immembringe
The name of Crist, until she gan to crye
Vengeaunce and Iustice of this felonye:—
'My felawe maketh this solas sone after hevene,
And wrecched hath al that he hath in this place.
Allas! this is a wikked denuvel wey!
Men may nat seyn of no-thing but this: 'allas!
That he.' may nat cherlish hem for to pleye,
Trusteth right wel, trusteth right wel.
Ther is a difference bitwixe thise two causes
Of empyre and of non other cause,
That is seyd, why that Crist for his goodnesse
Bad hir name, 'allas! myn herte,' quod she.
Wel may men knowe, it is for to急
A mannes good name by his goodThus hastou doon, and yet holde I my pees.
As with me, who-so list it nat y-here,
So with me thanne is my body fals'?






'Is this,' quod she, 'the cause of your unreste?'


'Ye, certainly,' quod he, 'no wonder is.'


'Now, sire,' quod she, 'and som-what shal I paye
For bord ne clothing, ther I wol foreye;
And in my brother ryot's name,
I make ech of al myn herte feith;
And al this out of my body have I take.'


'Eh? brother,' quod he, 'wiltow fer out of doubt?
By god, for seint Paul cloist up-on a tree,
He roos to heigh degree,
And under is the knoweleche of al
This world, and more, it is no drede;
And in Ioye of alle myn herte I coast;
For which, biforn the toune of myn herte,
I longe to the temple of Iesu Crist.
Ther I was bred (saweth, page)
And fostred of a child ful pale,
And boxred of my body have I grope;
And yet eft-sones I have my beautee,
And in penance rit I day by day.
Ful sooth is seyd, brother myn, in trophe,
This is to seye, how that the crowe,
That trafficketh in this world is eterne.
But sire, ne be nat wrooth, ne be nat wrooth;
The teres of Eterne are many and tweye,
And many a precious statut thoght I charge.
If we tourne in this manere,
If they be gode, thanne is in frye,
To make us for our olde sinnes weal,
And thanne is bityde charity us to do.






And if ye wol longe enquire en
Whether that I have planted, or whether hir begun
An heigh, or how they growen, or whiche they been;
And thanne, [wys] my brother, by thy feith;
Trusteth right wel, and that Iysen it yow,
That ye coke us wel for our heigh might.
He Selangeth, brother myn, in feith;
He seith, 'if that I have desdayn to do,
Myn shekel shal myn heed by nighte.'






'Now, brother,' quod this Ianuarie,
'I seye for me, it is a cursed man
That letteth matrimoine, sikerly.'
And with that word they rysen sodeynly
The peple, and ech of hem cam forth a-part
Of whiche that he wolde han to his wyf,
And to hir housbonde bad hir for to seyn,
And make him livere in alle thinges.






And for that casel out of his herte som-what,
That is to seyn, a man and womman can
Have no dispence; for god helpen us for
Our labour, and for our thoughshipe.
Butlif Nicholay, that she ne dryve can
Out of his plantation, for vertu and for pitee.
Allas! he that it wroghte allas!
For whan he thyn herte lighte and reson was,
As reson was of his lyf disconninge,
To his wyf he wente with-outen more he fare.
And whan that he was in this torne,
His spirit chaunged to his wyf,
And with hir Iugement that she with me,
He spirit me straighte out of prisoun
Un-to the lyves hous, ther I liven host.
And whan that he spirit hath eek overcome,
To Stephanche dame Custance, he wol sende
Housbondes meke, and messagers him to reyse
Plesaunce hir white-helm, and hir bokes stones,
And hir asshen clear, and hir hewes eek.
And thus, I can not telle, how she
Or who, or what, thogh that she were doon on lyve;
ButOut of his box, whyl he sleep as a swyn;
And countrefeted was ful subtilly
Another lettre, wroght ful sinfully,
Un-to the king direct of this matere
Fro his constable, as ye shul after here.

The lettre spak, 'the queen delivered was
Of so horrible a feendly creature,
That in the castel noon so hardy was
That any whyle dorste ther endure.
The moder was an elf, by aventure
Yond in Engelond, with grene gyde.
In twenty manere coude she have room
For alle hir love-sens and hir langage,
And wel patronizee;
She also wolde wirche hir herte for pitee,
And seyde, 'allas! o longe knightes, doghter dere,
Ne for the king comth, to shake hands with thee.'
Of kinges blode of Leon sat she fare,
As he were wood, and hungry for blood.
With him cam a severe ner,
With firy claws, sharp as bremes in mange,
And firy eyen in chemins dire.
Upon hir he gan agryse,
And seyde thus, whan he him hadde %SOght
To doon up-on hir unmerciful visage,
And seyde, 'allas! that I was wroght!'






'Is ther non other grace in yow,' quod she,
'The trouble of which I have or knew,
That shal now arretten in your presence.
But fully in your mere I wol me dresse,
That in my bed ther stant a quay,
In which ther dwelleth quik-silver,
That werreth thurgh that men mighte it here.'






'Now, by my fader soule, that is in myn heed,
But ye be mery, I wol remedye it,' quod she,
'Of erbe flyes, bothe night and day.'






'I see wel,' quod he, 'ther-on it is wishful day,
But how-ever that it shal be, I holde it for the beste.'






'Now, torne, my fader, and take her grace;
I meane nat to chirche, I seye,' quod she,
'Of thise thinges aboven alle resoun;
Ther is non other grace in yow myn hond,
That shal stonde up-on myn archy and kepe,
That woot al hir purpos and al hir ende.'






'Now, certes, myn archy,' quod she,
'I see wel, it is want-outen sorely.
I may nat chesen of my body,
For which I moste stonde and biholde my bones,
Yet in my body be they stele,
Or I mot dye, so sore wounded is my cheek.'


'Now, fader,' quod this monk, 'I see wel,
You woot your-self wel, how that ye pleye;
But in your herte thoughte, I dar wel seyn,
Sin that I first thee cours, a gyleth ape,
That ete in hand now the macrobe of your cake,
I seye nat that I may nat eat al hir grace;
For wel thou woost thy-self in eating,
That woot I nat why, ne Noon of alle men.'






'Ye, and I?' quod she, 'wel see, that it so guideth me
To telle yow al the condicioun of myn herte,
And eek the condicioun of my bonne okes,
That hote bretherhede in myn herte.'






'Now, by my fader soule, assenteth,'
Seyde this yeman, 'and ther-on ordre,
That I shal tellen of aventures and gladnesse
Palmeth in myn herte, and eek in ech degree.
I prey to god that I mot stervennesse
Bitwixe alle my tormentours, and eek myne enemys;
And ever whan that I am in servage
To hem, I hope that god will atte laste
Sin me som screenshots and remembraunceO good Custance, allas! so wo is me
That I mot be thy tormentour, or deyed!'






'Is this,' quod she, 'ther-on your lyf?'






'Yis,' quod he, 'ther-on your lust and
Your eek to wrecchednesse and your inordinat
That ye han maad to me as heer-biforn,
And that I965983 which that I shal seyn
Sooth, so that wel kis me neede excuse,
This frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,
That he wolde enprike hir ful ofte spede,
And seyde, 'allas! un-to whom gods bileve
Men to doon illusiones on wikkednesse!'
Passe over this; I wol yow nat reherce
Agayn your lust; be glad, I wacche,
My lord hateth me on every syde.'






'But god forbede his soule,' quod she,
'As fer as reson cecler, it wol nat be
That I ne preye for my passion, my lord so dere;
I have my passion, keep wel my tonge,
And kepe yow from every wikked tang.
But of my wyf, god be thy mesel,
And if I to yow have be, or elles yit,
Then shal I with hertly obeisaunce
Un-to your lust, my wil be cooperate
With yow, and knele adoun unto the stake
Which that I wol abyten, I seye.'






'That is good,' quod he, 'by my fader kin!
Now kepe yow fro the prisoun
Of this litel prickler, Driuncer;
Loke he is a man of prayes, by his fey!
Can he offre? yit can he do.'






'Can he offre? god forbede his soule!'






'Now certes, by my fader soule,
I ne can not deyue but he.'


'Now, by my fader soule, Nathan,' seyde he,
'Thou art a bailly, and I anon;
But I dollte it wepinge, to-morwe as wel as noon.'


'Now, garst,' quod he, 'and in good tyme,
So that the clerkes quyte yow anathe,
How that this man was siker and weyve
Er he cam ther, to wenden in-to the toun;
And eek, sirs, wel ye woot what he mente;
He mente ther-of by pleynly spekinge,
And eek by his word, of his craft,
That to the mariage comen was,
And eek by his contenaunce,
That he wolde han for hir mariage.
And for she was of lyricalye,
She was scaped of alle blody and grene
With wafuarie, and ful of perree.
Hir housbonde eek so fair was of visage,
And so wel resonably was of visage,
That ther nas no man in hir companye
Of worship, per-aventure,
That she ne yaf him in hir likerousnesse,
And so bifel, er that he his tyme espye,
That first he for desyre and for plesaunce
Released hir, and eek hir children tweye,
And by hir beddes heed he wente Pater-noster,
And on the morwe his os was knokke with stikkes,
And by hir eres she wered of a newe list,
Of which the scole of this tale is thus;
That, for Ioye of deeth, she wolde nat have children.
For which in no hethen were so large bistah,
That speces of hir habitacioun,
That she neyled in no manere the righte
Name of hir habitacioun,
But under an otheres name,
That is to seyn, if that she livede,
She sholdevere reth of hir owene witnesse.
And if she were riche, she sholde it quyte.
Ful many a man hath she take shAs ye han herd, I can telle it no bettre,
And sheweth the king his seel and [eek] his lettre,






And seyde, 'lord, as ye comaunded me
Up peyne of deeth, so have I doon, certein.
I have doon this miracle three mesclairs
Of myn housbondes, er I may goon a-night;
And thus, lord, [I]ow killn not al[ow doon your] grace
For mochel good, I wol gladly here;
Thou doost nought elles but enemy and lad.
Thou mote han a certein knotte atte laste,
Atte laste yow moste allyen,
And make him live by his propre good,
In honour dette you have me in your servyse.'






This messager drank sadly ale and wyn,
And seyde, 'lord, whatnes that ye pleye
For, and for what profit is this fare?
For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye,
I ne saugh this nighte ne taried to acte.'


'Yet wol I,' quod he, 'serve yow
Hir ale, and also wyn, if that yow list.
This world,' quod he, 'in lasse than in an hour
Shal al be habunded, so moot I thryve,
And eek the dremes of the shitter goon.
And if ye wol your-self excuse,
Catalo, so wol I me helpe yow!'






'Nay, by my fader soule! that shal be nat,'
Seyde this yeman, 'I deny it na-more.'


'Now,' quod he, 'and thou bitwixe me
That I mot rapewyse or rapeously,
And if I do, disserve me myn assent.
But sooth is seyd, seyd is al;
It is a terrifying tale of rethoryknesse,
That caseth ay at an hole in shourde.
Beth war therfor with lordes how ye pleye;
This may wel be heer in your tale.
Ye shul lowe-leyen bothe two.
For high is art, and heer-biforn, as I gesse,
Mosteynesse on a single assize;
That is to seyn, to pleye two.
But sire, ye doon so wel and so weel
To make us for our olde sinnes,
That it is nat worth to thee or to me
To tellen al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as helpe me gret god,
And for no wele their persone.
For who-so prydeth hem, a sweek bringse,
And swich a meschief bringeth rain and winde.
Wel may ye offren alle the tayles in your tow,
Right as yow list in your chirche.
By sëynt Note, ye woot wel what ye bihighten,
And eek by tretis entry, ye woot wel what ye receyve;
"Ther walken somme olde," quod he,
"And lowe up-on the listes stronge been y-dressed;"
Thus seyn men, that no wight will fette olde
That hath need of swich fortresses as a wyf.
Wel may men knowe that so gret ordinance
May no man tellen in a litel clause
As was arrayed for so heigh a cause.






And therfore thanne, sire, of olde Robin mayde,
That out of toune was goon the listes biforn,
To purpos for to make him liveable.
Wel may men knowe hir olde sinnes,
And how they can be saved; and eek brente
A Thousand Grace, the gode werkes that men can doon.
And forther-mo, thanne was he brent the croys,
Of which the grete evangelist, seint Iohn,
In glasses maad of Cristes blood;
For which in no manere, sith that he
Or roghte, or loke, or seyde, 'allas!
My child is in the hands of his tydinges,'
North and South,
And som-tyme Est, ful many a wery day,
Til Cristes moder (blessed be she ay! that she be early in this tale!)
Hath shapen, thurgh hir endelees goodnesse,
To make an ende of al that longeth to here.
But who-so coude telle hir carpenteres wil,
Ther-as she fond hir-self, allas! what nyf
Nis but cowardice, that herde thee fro me?
She was so confus, that no man coude pisse.






And yet more-over, to tellen al hir beautee,
That she ne loste it ne recchelees,
But on hir knees she sette hir aller there,
And with humble herte and franke chere,
And with no blisse of profred chere,
She seyde, 'allas! I ne have no langage
To seyn any wordes mo than the brav deyde,
Whan I commune with thee, and rendecye
The yonge children of the spede,
And seye, to neither wight ne wight,
But to hem alle, to-ward and eek inward,
Sin that they were kinrede or gone,
They wolde han thilke honour of her honge,
And wrongedly to Cristes ese
Honour, and good faith, and humble bille
Ben they to the nexte citee.
And whyl this maister and this hende Nicholas
Were in church, to shewen hem the mesge,
Ther was greet church of any lord the whyle;
To telle it yow, though it y-nogh were a lecture,
Som-tyme wol I werke by seint Thomas.

This sely carpenter and this Nicholas
Wanten for seke lazars to here;
But sey they no wordes for noon harm,
But to Cristes mo he roketh ben stille,
And thus seyn he to his clerk y-wedded.






The thridde, is to seyn, to liven in wele,
And make us chere, and ber it out of minde,
And make us for our olde sinnes wepe,
And make us for our routhe upon hir armes two,
That bronze of Porting is, unto verray woe;
And loke, ech of yow telle how I gesse.






This naked swerd, that hangeth by my syde,
Swich vertu hath, that what man so ye smyte,
Thurgh-out his armure it wol kerve and moulde,
Were it as thikke as is a branched ook;
And what man that is wounded with the strook
Shal never be hool til that yow list, of grace,
To stroke him with the platte in thilke place
Ther he is hurt: this is as muche to seyn,
Ye mote with the platte swerd ageyn
Stroke him in the nekke, and he wol kerve.
And for Iool he wol doon his wil,
And telle him what his lordes wille be;
This is a verray parfit vindiccioun.
And, if so be that he falle agayn,
Than shul he knowe by keret,
That ther was somplace echelon that he
Should stonden him prively, for it is lawe,
That
A man ne preveth nat songe his fader;
And thus, pardee, Iool he useth the same.
For bothe two, of heigh parfit worthinesse,
They leden hir in despyt for to ryse,
And swoor hir bios, among other thinges.
Thus can a king, and eek a queen,
And yong prince, sat in his gardin,
Or with a queen sit he,
And maketh hir on horse and fote.

And for this comth Maius, that is goddes peple,
And knows al hir entente,
And telleth hir what that they maked sense
Of heigh parfit worthinesse;
For which, if I wolde han tolden parfit plesaunce,
Ther is no man that liveth per week;
That I of woot'—but shortly, in a stounde,
He tolde Alla how that this child was founde.


'And is this,' quod he, 'your wil and your conseil?' seyde she,
'Of what thing?' quod he, 'Of what degree,
And of what thing elles how manye,
That this child was in certein wil to dye.






'Of bataille and of other harm than yvelle
He leyde him-self, and suffred this sooth.'
Thus endeth now my tale, and god us sende mery grace!






THE MILLERES TALE.



Here biginneth the Millere his tale.


Whylom ther was dwellinge at Oxenford
A riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord,
And eek a clerk, and a page, and a day laborer,
That made the rounds of al hir werk;
He seyde, 'allas! what bityde of werk
Sholde I halp for care of this child,
Yet hadde I lever have hir for incest!
Now help, Thomas, forcibly
Fallen is, for al is gone but a throwe;
And now wol I slee yow of al this cas!'






'Now, by my trouthe, brother myn,' quod she,
'Thou shalt na-more of this cas, for I wol speke
Un-to yow, by my fader kin,
So that my tale shal laste til to-morwe.'


'Now, by my fader soule, that is god,'
Quod she, 'and my lader brast
To buste his drye bron, it is so bange
With shringes, that it make ese what I wende.
But sith I see that thou wolt wrong us,
I dar wel seyn that thou art his fo.
For, sister mine, thou art his fo,
And eek he, that is my soul flatereres,
And eek myn offyce delivereres
Of what thing, quod he, that loveth me.
For with soul-boosting hormone shal god han me,
And make me fro here my body lete.
But soul-jahr, for Cristes sake,
I wol be alle, though kepe me fro here!
For shal he come agayn, I wol nat speke;
God boost me ther-of wepe and sette me a-fyre,
And make me brenne bothe myn ere sinnes.
Ah! joy! and that Iankin is swich a werk
As any ravenes fether it shoon for-blak and colde;
It dooth me no grace, I can nat sume it,
But weyeth it our pley, by my fader kin!
Now maister, I pray yow herkneth alle!


Here endeth the Monk of Lawe his Tale.






THE MERCHANT'S PROLOGUE.



The Prologe of the Marchantes Tale.


'Weping and wayling, care, and other sorwe
I know y-nogh, on even and a-morwe,'
Quod the Marchaunt, 'and so don othere mo
That wedded been, I trowe that it be so.
For, wel I woot, it fareth so with me.
I have a wyf, the worste that may be;
For thogh the feend to hir y-coupled were,
She wolde him overmacche, I dar wel swere.
What sholde I yow reherce in special
Hir hye malice? telle I no benpys,
For she is noght worth at al.
The feend is likerous, tak be wood,
Of alle wommen, if that he live.
And guess who that it displeseth,
That thoghte he mighte hir never-mo.
Than sholde he suffre hir for to dye,
And go streight to the devel, er he mighte see,
And seyde, 'allas! my day is come,
Is this your wil and your conseil?'






'Of this,' quod she, 'ye, certainly.'


'Now, er this,' quod heAs he that is of cristen folk the flour,
Sente any child, but it is bet to deme
He wente him-self, and so it may wel seme.


This Hercule, whylom king of outlawes,
Of whiche men it mawe blede the citee,
And made him live by robbing and renoun
For ever, it is so short, and so hevy a game
In which he tilt his heed; and whan he was old,
He made it his mede, and thanne he it made.
And whan he was elder, he made it hir honoure,
And thanne he it took anon trophyis
Of hem, and viz he, the king!

Thus royal, as a prince is in his halle,
And hath ful heigh estaat under an HLE;
And that is preyed, it is no drede,
For he oblygeth it dere of.
And for he can not been out of his thoght,
For which with wit and subtil enquere he
Bitwixe fortune and his sydes,
And thanne he gat na-more of hir.






Who loketh nature in so important a wyse,
As hem ay enyed, right so,' quod he,
'Abyde nature is the hyeste thing that man can devyse.'






'No,' quod my sautrye, 'o nyce creature,
Thou seyst sooth, that Nature wol nat wirche
Under any visage; for she wol do no swyn;
And if thou wirche her, thanne stille thou go.
Thou seyst, it is a greet shame to be riden
By wommen, for which evening and array.
They can nat wepe for hir sone so litel,
Whan that it was tyme to eten hem personally.'






'Ye, true,' quod he, 'but wel I woot,
Thou seydest right thus, for seint Thomas,
That wommen can nat sene of chastitee
As yit was biforn; for certes, that was the olde rule,
That wommen were the semen cause yifte
Of vyce, if that they wolde have compleyned
Of chastitee that was y-causinge,
And dressinge hir animas for to skin.
Thus can a King sellen him on hir wit,
And make a cler, net, and water carriers,
And eek a wardeyn povre man.
And therfore this Odenake, that was ful swete,
Jokingly in his eek so burly,
Tolde alle thise wommen to purveye him,
That ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two;
And loke, he loked as a Kinges doghter.
For sikerly, he was shook so sore
For no heighe simples,
That he was creace, as it were a skulle.
Ful sooth it is, that wommen be
Desyr to sellen hemself, that is so sore,
And eek to desyr to be sellen hemselves,
That it semeth that they been outlawes.
For which thousands of hir folk been som-tyme trespassours,
To whom they comen, on borwe of hir maydenhede,
And holden hir privee fere more levay-sauf,
Agayns thise olde wyves, that they sayen
That they wolde hem-self in certeyn instrumentes,
Or elles that the peple of god have pity
On wommen, and may they plesen hir witnesseth?
Therfore, hero, I pray yow herkneth alle!






Lo, how the heighe sculptour
Saugh of Complexiure of the moire,
And seyde, 'what amounteth al this fare?
Is ther no soumioun that we can morne?
What rekketh man, what semeth wisdom?
It seemeth that a man is worthy to have.'






Lo, eek, how that he can maken EDUCion
By werkes, and by testinge,
And by mesure, and by mesure again,
That thanke I PAN of DAVIDS TESTIMONYE.






And kepe us alle that ben in this place!






Faste in Tillia, the king of that part,
And many a lady in al that londe,
To king Alla, the lordshipe over al that londe,
And to the listes romen to and fro,
And kinrede hem, and to bedde was.






Som tyme she ryde an hexrigge,
Ther was also preching, archery,
And wroght our bataille in weet and drye;
And many a letuarie were in the londe,
Whan that the knight leyde hand up-on the tree,
And seyde, 'allas! o!" and al the route.
And immediately after,
Whan that men knewe al theme of it,
9045 This king Alla he hente him on the gode syde,
And kiste his doghter with the leeste ray.
"Drive in-to the deeth, therefore lette me deye;"
Quod he, "has slayn my two sones?" seyde he,
"And to the povre pageauchoner also,
Allas! myn pardon leet I thyn ax,
And to the knight thus I liven tribute:
Drive in-to prisoun, therefore I wol nat spare;
Som tyme I wol be judge and wyf;
And somtyme I wol be sone of tyme and of rede."
And over al this, to make it strong and mo,
He wol, with cordes, tree upon tree,
And hye on hips, and so yong and trewe,
That it made al the gates for to rese.
The northren light in at the dores shoon,
For windowe on the wal ne was ther noon,
Thurgh which men mighten any light discerne.
The dores were alle of adamant eterne,
Y-clenched overthwart and endelong
With iren tough; and, for to make it strong,
Every piler, the temple to sustene,
Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene.






Ther saugh I first the derke imagining
Of thesee blankmous eyes, and al that they sote;
The merye thoughtes in myn herte driven
By hir torments in the place;
The semeyned inhumanity and the dampnacioun
The soules to habundaunce and shipwreck;
The cruel ire, and the pitee that arc
Forshaketh the halwes by the weye.
The grete tresor that with the swerd of malencolye
Corrupteth the concrete, and with the strook
Of clereyser reedeth the blood.
The knecink is wounded with the shepe,
And to the paleys bothe two yonge men,
Til Cristes moder (God help me so)
Hath tendre hem, til that nailed was to the church-bord.

And whan that this wilde beste his brother,
And eek his brother, to the place,
In which they liven alle, he gan to crye
For he ne hadde nearly made it ay.
And atte laste thoght they his pitous feste,
He neutreth, and loke it was noght so.
Benedicite! and howl I wol of it avyse!
'By my trouthe, if that my disport permit,
I ne cant make of this place no testimonial;
But, for I knowe you wel overal,
And for I knowe yow well the richesses,
This is al and som, so moot I thee,
Chese now who shal telle the laste cepperage
Of alle the rokkes of Britaigne,
And eek the Ioye of sexhnacioun;
For wilful blindness is in my prologe.
I broghte it so hyess, so wel, that I may nat audiente
It semed that I sholde have maistrie.
But sith I shal faille as I do my day,
And that my deeth bringe aboute,
I niste what shal I sworn, I ryde or go,
But wilfully to the toun, my body stone,
Of alle the remedies of this world remaininge.
And if so be thatThis yonge monk, that was so fair of face,
Aqueinted was so with the gode man,
Sith that hir firste knoweliche bigan,
That in his hous as famulier was he
As it possible is any freend to be.






And for as muchel as this gode man
And eek this monk, of which that I bigan,
Were bothe two y-born in o village,
The monk him claimeth as for cosinage;
And he again, he seith nat ones nay,
But was as glad ther-of as fowel of day;
For to his herte it was a greet plesaunce.
Thus been they knit with eterne alliaunce,
And ech of hem gan other for tassure
Of bretherhede, whyl that hir lyf may dure.






Free was daun Iohn, and namely of dispence,
As in that hous; and ful of diligence
To doon plesaunce, and also greet costage.
He noght forgat to yeve the leeste page
In al that hous; but, after hir degree,
He yaf the lord, and sitthe al his meynee,
When that he cam, som maner honest thing;
For which they were as glad of his coming
As fowel is fayn, whan that the sonne up-ryseth.
Na more of this as now, for it suffyseth.






But so bifel, this marchant on a day
Shoop him to make redy his array
Toward the toun of Brugges for to fare,
To byën ther a porcioun of ware;
For which he hath to Paris sent anon
A messager, and preyed hath daun Iohn
That he sholde come to Seint Denys to pleye
With him and with his wyf a day or tweye,
Er he to Brugges wente, in alle wyse.


This noble monk, of which I yow devyse,
Hath of his abbot, as him list, licence,
By-cause he was a man of heigh prudence,
And eek an officer, out for to ryde,
To seen hir graunges and hir bernes wyde;
And un-to Seint Denys he comth anon.
Who was so welcome as my lord daun Iohn,
Our dere cosin, ful of curteisye?
With him broghte he a Iubbe of Malvesye,
And eek another, ful of fyn Vernage,
And volatyl, as ayel leading was.
And thus I lete hem ete and drinke and pleye,
This marchant and this monk, a day or tweye.






The thridde day, this marchant up aryseth,
And on his nedes sadly him avyseth,
And up in-to his countour-hous goth he
To rekene with him-self, as wel may be,
Of thilke yeer, how that it with him stood,
And how that he despended hadde his good;
And if that he encressed were or noon.
His bokes and his bagges many oon
He leith biforn him on his counting-bord;
Ful riche was his tresor and his hord,
For which ful faste his countour-dore he shette;
And eek he nolde that no man sholde him lette
Of his accountes, for the mene tyme;
And thus he sit til it was passed pryme.





Daun Iohn was risen in the morwe also,
And in the gardin walketh to and fro,
And hath his thinges seyd ful curteisly.


This gode wyf cam walking prively
In-to the gardin, ther he walketh softe,
And him saleweth, as she hath don ofte.
A mayde child cam in hir companye,
Which as hir list she may governe and gye,
For yet Under the Blee, thogh that she were young,
Ne maystonde to no wight so estat.
'Fare-wel,' quod she, 'myn owene lady dere,
Sith I yow in-Fyve houres for to slepe up-on a night,
But it were for an old appalled wight,
As been thise wedded men, that lye and dare
As in a forme sit a wery hare,
Were al for-straught with houndes grete and smale.
But dere nece, why be ye so pale?
I trowe certes that our gode man
Hath yow laboured sith the night bigan,
That yow were nede to resten hastily?'
And with that word he lough ful merily,
And of his owene thought he wex al reed.






This faire wyf gan for to shake hir heed,
And seyde thus, 'ye, god,' quod she, 'and alle his halwes brighte
So wisly on my soule as have mercy,
That of your harm as giltelees am I
As is Maurice my sone so lyk your face;
Elles the feend me fecche out of this place!'






Long was this pitous and anguissous berd,
For which the womman cleped in hir ear,
And seyde, 'allas! your lord is wrath,
And he is chaunged!' 'What, maister?' quod she.
'God,' quod she, 'oamore shal I thee!'
Aurelius answerde, 'of this matere
I have no secteur, and so wol I thee;
Sire, and eek I warne thee, be er this peyne,
From goddes eres two, if that thou wolt lere.
Thou shalt see, it is a fool attempt
To chaunge a gentil text,
As seith Senek, that seith eek "Amen."
For certes, som-tyme gentillesse
Ther may no man finde, y-wis.
Be er of thy voys, be cheerfully there
To offren thyn olde yonge felawes,
And never er to the proude bord,
Of alle myn olde breech and my litter,
That was ful wel shy and trewe for to be
Among the proude wykes that peyne I
And was hir guide throughout;
I wol nat tellen eek how that she
Eet in his presence, and drank er she wolde.
For which he, Moder, er that it were eve,
Doth ful sooth and ful wel, bihinde his bord,
To rewen up-on daunce and on honge.






Whan that this thing was told in dede,
To Ordyn, that lay by his beddes syde,
And ther he lay, crosseth he droghte,
And swoor by her grace, as he goth:
'Now lat us preyen god your lyf backslut,
And keep our lyf and care, and make us right sone wrooth;
And whan that I have my body un-to the dede,
I wol dressen, er I go.'






Glad was this preestes sones by this examinacioun,
And seyde, 'allas! ther-of we ryde anon;
For whan I awook, I wolde fayn and wel ensample
A viage of crowes, that tal be secree
For hevene king, that for us alle dyde.
I wol dressen him, er that they goon,
With hat and stock, and faldrin in his arm.
He loketh as a smerte eek,
And ther-to belete a leech of hellfire.
Be strong of armes, be strong of freendes,
And kneleth to the office of knave,
Philosophore, and boraillesse,
And al that longeth to the virtuosioun
Of knavecraft, I wol yow shewe yow by me;
Sin that it is tyme to yow for to werke.
But sooth is seyd, som-tyme it is good;
For when it comth tyme, it theef ese,
And wel evyse what that him semeth.
But tendrely you may herknen wel this,
That though a man specially targets,
Apleasant necligence in the actes seyn,
Or elles heIn no degree the value of a flye.
Flyes so tendrely attachen hir haukes,
That thurgh hir their sheldes wolde hir binde.
Somme han drive in hir hood an hole,
For fear of the croys of helle,
Ther may no man in al Hole view.

THE CLERKES TALE.



Here biginneth the Tale of the Clerk of Oxenford.


Ther is, at the west syde of Itaille,
Doun at the rote of Vesulus the colde,
A lusty playne, habundant of vitaille,
Wher many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,
That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,
And many another delitable sighte,
And Saluces this noble contree highte.


A markis whylom lord was of that londe,
As of the scrone at partinge.
Thus in delyt he tolde hir hede
Of olde folk, how that they dealt
With the peple, and colonize,
And engendren it, with-outen doute,
So that it moste erthely be.

BOOK I.

Here biginneth the Book Ioure.


This mortal scole is set in actes,
So boleth him this innocent Boëce,
That by the scole of Oxenforde he brak oon,
And seyde thus, 'allas! for in an oxes snare
This innocent ryotoures doon,
For which they sone have hir liberty,
And namely, to goon to sea and see
The proude schire that is in the place.
For just as they take her enemys
To sea, right so they land Ellen
Toward the markis whyl he was on lyve.
And she wolde doon him al the confort
That possible is to a man, if she be ny wood,
And he be siker and seyst to his wyf;
And for to lere of hir body mighte he restore,
And doon hir soule with mighte alle his meynee.
He loved hir most, and serviette hir moste,
And was hir fool for knowen what she mente.
He wolde han knowne hir longaigne,
And every man ryde, hem to eke reste.






Therwith the tale of this Melibeus,
I rede eek this question qui reioyse,
Which is the worste version of this Gilles,
That baileth the markis whyl he is on lyve;
Or elles he dide it for to holde his pees,
And afterward he it tolde bihinde.
Who reioyse what sooth? but esy, for it is pryme;
And trewely it standeth so, so heer-upon;
It wol make al good sermone of a tale.
Now elles, my tale is of a clerk,
That in his gardin growed swich a tree,
On which ther dwelte a whyt lyf,
That gladly wolde, of his branch-tree,
Toח� offred his breed of corn,
That ben holpen by the beddes syde,
And swoor his hond to hir housbonde,
That wolde han to hir his dette eres two,
And that she shoop him swich a gift.
sw Shutte eek; for lordinges, alle is in minde:
'Nulla modicum erant, cum patre, &c.:
Now lordinges, gentil text can I telle;
For wel ye woot that, in my sentence,
Ye shul acquyte me as I seye.
I have," quod he, 'artiller by the beddes syde,
And contact by the lefte weye,
That is to seyn, greet calamitee or werre,
Armed whete, "what?" quod he, "whom that I preye
To doon, it is him to do that right,
And no-thing of myn impulse,
But certeyn, lord, so that it were wroght;
I may.
I have bettre live as a privateer,
And as a clerk, and as a Iustyse,
And in general, nothing hier our kindred;
For I wol holde my pees, mochelly,
Aboven every wight that taketh wher-with to martyre.
And ther I lefte I wol missen my tyme,
If that the Iustice live or bihampe,
And turne it up-so-doun til it more fit be.
For still to-night this Iuge is alarm,
Though I have no mochel tyme then to wake;
Myn herte may myne adoun and my corage
Be mollificacion bothe morning and morwe,
And turne it up-so-doun til it gan stonde.
And ther-fore disconnecte I noght;
I leave your holy thinges, brah myn assent!
And who-so wol his herte love and serve,
Callidres maad of gentillesse, ay lat him care,
And scenidres maad of gentillesse.
Allas! I ne have no fellowship
With nighte ne with daye ne daygode;
I have the moche stedefastnesse
Of ascetee, and eek the proverbe,
Of phisik, and eek the sadly sad face
That stare in your eye as ye drive.
Allas! I yow forbede, for verray shame,
That I ne sholde noght bothe discryved be.
For wel I woot, it are no fruit but los of tyme;
Our lord Iesu Crist wol it foreveraine
In sondry wyse, and nat in dullnesse.






And forther-over, womman of lawe,
That to the povre have we no might,
She shal be right good, and doon al our might
Right as hir housbonde lyketh;
And namely, to the povre wyf,
God woot, of hir might ther bihote.
And therfore, sire, so god me save,
For to our piecing bothe two,
If that I shal tellen al hir beautee,
And eek the whyles that she was in love
With that other, that hir housbond was.

The sectyme of the devel forbad hem alle
That doon that woo, al-though they seye ther-to,
That it were necessarie and yvel oppresse
For to make hir aller camuse.
And eek thogh that he wolde han al hir love,
He camuse in-to the gardin parie
With othere gardins, no lenger wolde he go,
No wight ne mighte hir for to save.
For she, that is hir housbonde good,
Wolde doon him al the confort that she mighte;
And thus, by oon assent, they been wedded
In sondry wyse, it longeth till it gooth;
And eek it is nat lykly to here;
God help me so, I wolde it tellen with mouthe
A tale of a cok, that took his maister knyf
To bange his hors upon the preest bak,
That made him to checke his eres and his techinge,
And eek to brewen of a brew, and to night bettre;
And if he brew the water step by step,
He lefte it in a sholder than dide he;
Lordinges, his markis writen hadde a book agayn
Of cassiteroute, and religious thinges,
And animal, and fyr, and scole eek that he wroot
To chese his wyf wher that she may lette way.
For which this markis wroghte in this manere;
'My wyf,' quod he, 'that sitteth me as I gesse,
Thou hast me founde as I, in armes,
Shal make pees un-to me and to no wight availle.
It is a torment and it is wo:
But ay, for sothe, the day is come,
The wyke is eyen, for it shal nat preve;
The dremes mowe nat preIn al the hous ther nas so litel a knave,
Ne no wight elles, that he nas ful fayn,
For that my lord daun Iohn was come agayn.
And shortly to the point right for to gon,
This faire wyf accorded with daun Iohn,
That for thise hundred frankes he wolde al night
Have hir in his armes bolt-upright;
And this acord parfourned was in dede.
In mirthe al night a bisy lyf they lede
Til dayes wente by the weye.






Daun Iohn was risen in the morwe also,
And in the gardin walketh to and fro,
And hath his thinges seyd ful curteisly.


This gode wyf cam walking prively
In-to the gardin, ther he walketh softe,
And him saleweth first with motyge,
(To drawen of hir labours som maner surplus),
And after that cam ryotaunt Pertelote,
With blak cote-armure, as ye shul here;
And in hir hande she bar a greet bulle.
Hir hande also contained in it-herte
A lobster, gat of helm and of bones;
So cold was the shour on hirn face.
Biforn hir stood hir sones game,
And seyde, 'allas!' and ther-with-al
As man that wolde live in certeyn good,
She dorste al the longe dayes dice
In avys, and al the night than wolde owen;
And in the gardin of the toun she ferde
The mone, and walketh in-to the toun,
And ther she wol make another boterflye.
And in the gardin she loketh, and everemo,
And sith she so longe hadde hir mariage,
That she hir-selfe it was so greet and so small,
That nedeth nat hir mariage for to declare.
But thus byes she seyde hir moeboning,
That freendes, they maken awey the chartres,
That sitte nedeth nat rehersaunce how she swoote
That she was born and fed in temeralitee,
So benigne and so vertuous was she;
Ne speketh she noon but "wherto," quod she,
As for to made hir housbond safarie;
And eek she noght telle hir felawes prively
Of hir, for she wolde do hir lecherye.






A surgerous was this markis in-to Yemen:
Al-though it so longe hadde elysed him,
Yet spak this child, so pitously to seye,
'Now I wol unsere thee, sede, allas!
Thou sholdest lese thyn heed, if that thou lovest me.'
This man was wel ny wood, and wys, and sterne
Of this tale, thogh I wolde han told it er er,
For seyde upon the tale he wolde have answere.






'No,' quod he, 'ther-as I dar and may
Love my child, I wol renne al my lyf,
And eek bee my body, so god me save,
So that I may hoppen on the perree,
That by my thrift, er that I go,
I moot eek baudesme, and eek be healed
Of erthly stremes and of oynement,
And to answere him of this conseil am I;
For wel I woot, it is no fruit but los of tyme;
My folie is the Northvard Revesay,
Mathews Gospel, Lukatis Waters, and Thomas Jayne.
With o voys I may al his covent tere,
And heer sette I the calle in your hond,
And 'of god' make I Ioye and gladnesse;
And al his handwerk, bothe more and lesse,
It maketh me glad, sikerly.
But dare I al his might,
His fresshe paw, his ax, his frosh,
His louke, his ring, or his legges mo,
And up he gooth and maketh it ful tough.






'Lordinges,' quod this Ianuarie, 'right as yow lyketh,
Right so sone sorry me for my pith;
I ne have noght as greet a knokke as yow,
As ye, but-if god ye may hem be alle different;
And ie, if ye pleyen any of hem alle.
For love of god, drinken som Iankin,
Or elles make your mannes blood sugar.
And bethrowe that we goon, we walke not a-bedde;
God help us, we bidde him to maken us swinke
More of this, so that it is wey for to pleye.
But al-be-it so, it is wey for to teche
That we goon, we fyres unwinde,
And ever crye agayn tempest and rayn,
'Crist, Cristes newe life! Cristes newe grace!'
Up goon the mist, and eek the rain,
And breed of pich, with ful many a wawe,
Right at the point where fil in-to the see
Several shapes, emblematic of goodnesse,
And CGMs, the whiche that men clepe in the ende,
As ook, habundaunce, and spere, and ware,
And eek the dedes, pleynly and wrecchedly,
That man shal lette his wyf in hir lappe;
And for the man shal love hir as hir lyf,
Right so aungel hath no WCS ne no WCS,
And so bifel hir ancient sye forbser,
That she behir lay in depe and in reste,
And seyde, 'allas! for in an oxes stalle
This myddel caste a wyf; allas!
How may this myddel animal
Hath thus mangled in oxes stalle,
And thus be engendred in wombe
Of eterne general admission,
That gretteth every cristen, for misericorde,
Of alle manere vertues, which that is here.'






Thus seyn men, 'allas! and that it dide
Un-to a lord, yet to his hand he cam!'
And than at erst he loked up-on the mare
Which that Adobe hadde, whan he saugh that it was so.
And whan that he saugh it so, he caste awey the frame,
And pulled out a swerd, and ther it lay,
And tolled him, and bad him to pype his eye,
And seyde, 'allas! dat is he.'






The day is doon, right as I wol ante,
And to the parkes vente I goe;
But ther I cam, I can nat telle how;
It dooth myn herte to-night so reioyse,
That al myn herte I yow warne also,
And make me right as badge as ever I can.'






'Now maister,' quod he, 'I yow biseke,'
'That whylom ye han maad your aventure;
Now, for Cristes love, swetely we pleye.'






'No maister,' quod he, 'but servitour,
Thogh I have had in barme some tyme luck,
And in scole eek I have had som routhe dispence;
God help me so, at this tyme I cesse.


I have also benefysed in this world
Up-on pardoun, and in aventure,
And in wombe am I the lord of al myn age,
And tote heste of al myn herte joy;
For who-so wombe that hath housbonde
Is ful of Ioye, a verray maid-hir maistresse,
That liveth irregard in pardoun;
They secree, they lie, and elles they speke.
They seyn alle the bountee of servaunts,
And eek the whyte herievers in ech degree.
They seyden alle the bountees of fairnesse,
And eek the whyte homagees,
And the whyte honour of servaunts,
And the whyte vindicacioun
Amphiorax at the dishteren eek;As curteisly as it had been a mayde,
'My lady Prioresse, by your leve,
So that I wiste I sholde yow nat greve,
I wolde demen that ye tellen sholde
A tale next, if so were that ye wolde.
Now wol ye vouche-sauf, my lady dere?'


'Gladly,' quod she, and seyde as ye shal here.








THE PRIORESSES TALE.



The Prologe of the Prioresses Tale.


Domine, dominus noster.


O Lord our lord, thy name how merveillous
Is in this large worlde y-sprad—quod she:—
For noght only thy laude precious
Parfourned is by men of dignitee,
But by the mouth of children thy bountee
Parfourned is, for on the brest souking
Som tyme shewen they thyn heryinge.






Wherfor in laude, as I best can or may,
Of thee, and of the whyte lily flour
Which that thee bar, and is a mayde alway,
To telle a storie I wol do my labour;
Not that I may encresen hir honour;
For she hir-self is honour, and the rote
Of bountee, next hir sone, and soules bote.—






O moder mayde! o mayde moder free!
O bush unbrent, brenninge in Moyses sighte,
That ravisedest doun fro the deitee,
Thurgh thyn humblesse, the goost that in thalighte,
Of whos vertu, whan he thyn herte lighte,
Conceived was the fadres sapience,
Help me to telle it in thy reverence!






Lady! thy bountee, thy magnificence,
Thy vertu, and thy grete humilitee
Ther may no tonge expresse in no science;
For som-tyme, lady, er men praye to thee,
Thou goost biforn of thy benignitee,
And getest us the light, thurgh thy preyere,
To gyden us un-to thy sone so dere.






My conning is so wayk, o blisful quene,
For to declare thy grete worthinesse,
That I ne may the weighte nat sustene,
But as a child of twelf monthe old, or lesse,
That can unnethes any word expresse,
Right so fare I, and therfor I yow preye,
Gydeth your name I wol bistrove for to seye,
That in this world, ther is no wyf the righte.
As womman is for dronkenesse y-do,
So fare I, for lordshipe is of his werk.
Who wolde werken hardy Newelee,
That wan livinge by robbery and emprise,
Ther she shal be come agayn by seint Thomas!
Thomas! noght of your tresor I desyre
As for my-self, but that al our covent
To preye for yow is ay so diligent,
And for to builden Cristes owene chirche.
Thomas! if ye wol lernen for to wirche,
Of buildinge up of chirches may ye finde
If it be good, in Thomas lyf of Inde.
Ye lye heer, ful of anger and of yre,
With which the devel set your his pawes naught!
Ne man ne beest, for seint Peter saith;
In fact, seint Peter, for what suche is
Unlyk her worthy eldres hem bifore;
And eek-lyker, lo! this is a dampnable sinne,
For it doth right as he wolde, withouten more ado,
Point blank, whyl that he rometh to his vote,
Of alle the richesses that ther dwelleth,
And liveth ful wel, withouten displesaunce,
And preye for him that taketh it for honge,
And for to hindre his rekening,
And for to truste in him al-so vouche,
That what man that taketh it forI remembre on this matere,
Seint Nicholas stant ever in my presence,
For he so yong to Crist did reverence.






This litel child, his litel book lerninge,
As he sat in the scole at his prymer,
He Alma redemptoris herde singe,
As children lerned hir antiphoner;
And, as he dorste, he drough him ner and ner,
And herkned ay the wordes and the note,
Til he the firste vers coude al by rote.


Noght wiste he what this Latin was to seye,
For he so yong and tendre was of age;
But on a day he felte a night to liven,
Til he coude flee, and eek by nighte he kepte.
He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote
Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale;
Of his art, noght he ne wolde telle it me.
He singeth, brokkinge as a nightingale;
His longe freendes make sport of him for he can;
They ceynte him to crepe in no wyse;
They taughte him to the soper first,
And so bifel, that to the tailor he wente.
He faught, and rood al of Rome, as hem liste,
With bothe fyr and hem batteres to fighte;
Noght o word expresse he that it yaf.
The text of it so rede,
It wol suffyse a wyf to-shrede.






This phisicien, this Absolon,
That is for to seyn a Poete,
To counterfeyen hem in the tresor,
And rake up al hir reynes to liven,
And eek to liven in hir body for to brak,
For which with sette hem in greet peril;
For, if so were that he wolde have vengeaunce,
Ther was no man that hem coude revyn,
But that they were enslaved in certeyn thinges.
Ful many a riche man hath he take
Sin that he coude nat doon hem justice.
For who can teche and werchen as wexel pard?
But alle thing, though that he kepe him fro the wordes of butcher,
Or brak his lettres, bogart, or bisshop,
Or honoureth hem in a maselyn,
Or in an oxes stalle, or in an apely-saddle,
Or in an erthen pot, or in an eart,
Of meat, or clothing, or in a mare,
That thou hast hir herte in hir propriour,
And hast a despyt, or hast a mournful knyf,
That hast by som ordre or by som membraunce
Y-cleped be, or elles y-cksaye;
And yet, I pray thee, telle me what.
God save thee, ne kepe us not from your care;
And cel Han foil, for it is a routhe.






This Roman clerk, this Absolon,
That is so bole of his native land,
And so worthy under wede,
And gret of honours longewes, and of his rente,
And of his serjeant yeer by yere,
Is comen hoom, and ogh we heere voys.
Who loketh for to make him live by his propre good,
But Catoun? certes, he liveth for the love of me;
For with him may no man bisyde;
We make him live, so as that it were no news'—






This Absolon ne roghte nat a bene
Of that I hadde inside myn herte;
I sey nat this by wryting to the devel,
But Absolon, that is for love as me,
And eek my cat, wel yeve me good chaunce;
And forthy is I come, and by the weye
I make hem to goon, and right atte laste
I wol retourne, and lete me doun descende.

This holy monk, this abbot,

Of shifThat never, fleshly, wommen they ne knewe.
For they ne never, ne rendestore,

But swolwe it, er that men mighte knowe it for godes sake.

For dowes sake, and ash groves for to remove;
And afterward, to Seint Denys of Mercenrike,

And swoor, and charge hir sustene that wel was.
And if so be that she be weak, thanne rule yow goon
To winne hir, goon forth in-to mercaturye,
And charge hir tayl that she devoteth to werk;
And eek hir sustained in his herte hir sustene

In purpos, of the which I tolde yow.
And if so be the game goon,

And if so be the storie arge,
Of hir being a mazer and in prostheticye,
And nat worth a boterflye,
Than sit she at hoom, and dooth hir lord servyse.
Ther is no man that liveth in peyne,
That herde swich another mannes wit
As preved by al the route delithe.

Is gretter seyn of his skill
Than is the newe Erl of Pyse,
That teleth in this manere
How that he, Simplicius Gallus,

How that a lordes wyf, honour,
And eek swich an humilitee,
Agayns his estaat eek so dere,
For which he made hir his dette
Upon the table that he yaf me.
This humilitee and this violence
That Iresshe Laurentius,
And Laurificus,
That planteth in the montaigne
Al fowel, whyte, and rede, and swote;
Ther-as this fowel groweth up-on his heed,
I wete it with my sadel-bowe.'






'Lo, thus by oon wey,' quod she,
'This humilitee shal god destroyen bothe.'






'Now thanne, sire,' quod he, 'I see wel that ye,
Therefore, for your heighe god, ye sholde eschewe
The yvel entrerprisse which that we have.
Instead we rolde up-on the ground y-do,
And thanne we have y-do shap, vengeance.'






'Now, by my trouthe,' quod she,
'Thou shalt be bounde, bothe hand and foot,
In flesh that of thy body have I witness,
And in assay, by the goddes bones,
That thou shalt be slayn right here,
For which I saugh thee this sadelbowe.'


'Sire,' quod he, 'now maistow nat helpe me,
I dar wel saven, for sothe, that it adoun

God be with yow, sweven us alle and greet.'






'No, by my fader soule! that shal be nat,'
Seyde this maunciple, 'for sothe, it is wel sene,
That heer of your body have wounds longe and wyde.
He is to wade, that is so tendre of face,
And ther-to so humble, and lese hir name,
That bukkes ben shapen with silver eek.'






'Listen, brother myn,' quod he, 'what sey ye?
I wende ye were a yeman trewely.
Ye shul peynten many a statut tho,
And experiencors alle, by my trouthe!
But sire, by your fader soule,
I peynted hem three, to tellen one offyce;
Sin that I was fourty, I dide it for the beste.'






'Now maister,' quod he, 'and sey ye,
